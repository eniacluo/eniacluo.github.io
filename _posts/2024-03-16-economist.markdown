本周的封面 (This week’s covers)
=======================

我们眼中的世界 (How we saw the world)
---------------------------

本周我们有两个封面故事，一个关于美国令人瞩目的经济以及可能阻碍它的因素，另一个关于俄罗斯举行另一场选举，以确认普京为总统。

THIS WEEK we have two covers, on America’s remarkable economy and what could stop it, and on Russia as it stages another election to acclaim Vladimir Putin as president.

到了2023年4月，我们的牛仔已经矗立在大草原之上。新版本中，他已高耸云端。这很合适：尽管利率飙升，与中国的贸易战以及乌克兰和中东的实际战争，美国经济仍然坐稳鞍座。


In April 2023 our cowboy had been towering over the prairie. The new version had him above the clouds. That was fitting: America’s economy has remained in the saddle despite sharp interest-rate rises, a trade war with China and real wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.

但是，除非你记得去年的封面，这幅图像有点费解。为什么马儿在对流层上空？它站在什么上面？为什么它的腿这么长？

However, unless you remembered last year’s cover, the image was a bit baffling. Why was the horse up in the troposphere? What was it standing on? Why were its legs so long?

我们考虑了另外两个想法。

We thought some more and came up with two other ideas.

一个是基于星条旗的。我们保留了星星不变，但将条纹转换成了条形图。这个设计非常简洁美观。但它存在一个根本问题。尽管美国经济确实是奇迹般的，但我们却将其过去十年的增长翻了一番。实际上，它只增长了约四分之一。我们觉得这样做过于夸张。

One was based on the Stars and Stripes. We left the stars untouched, but converted the stripes into a bar chart. This was beautifully simple. But it suffered from a fundamental problem. Although the American economy is indeed miraculous, we had it doubling in size over the past decade. In reality, it has grown by about a quarter. We felt that was taking too much of a graphical liberty.

我们的第二个想法是，一个肌肉贲张的健美运动员？这个形象很好地揭示了增长故事的一个弱点。美国经济迅速扩张的一个重要原因是新冠疫情刺激措施，相当于国内生产总值的26%，是富裕国家平均水平的两倍以上。然而，这剂类固醇不能重复使用——今年美国将花费更多资金用于债务利息而非国防。事实上，贸易保护主义以及在未来的唐纳德·特朗普总统任期内，对非法移民的大规模驱逐可能会威胁到贸易和劳动力供应，并对增长前景造成真正的危害。

How about our second idea, a rippling bodybuilder? This image got nicely at a weakness in the growth story. One big reason the economy has expanded so fast is the pandemic stimulus, worth 26% of GDP, more than double the rich-world average. Yet that dose of steroids cannot be repeated—America will this year spend more on debt interest than on defence. Indeed, protectionism and, under a future President Donald Trump, the mass deportation of illegal immigrants could yet threaten trade and the supply of labour and do real harm to the prospects for growth.

这个形象在我们的同事中引发争议。一些人担心它会以错误的方式走红，人们会分享它是因为我们健美运动员的紧身短裤，而不是我们的观点。也许我们可以丢弃紧身短裤？一个体面地放置的图表怎么样——一种财政遮羞布？

The image divided our colleagues. Some worried that it would go viral in the wrong way, and that people would share it because of our bodybuilder’s trunks rather than our own ideas. Perhaps we could jettison the jockstrap? How about a tastefully placed chart—a sort of fiscal fig leaf?

最终，我们决定加倍努力，在白色背景上摆放一条白色内裤。这个形象是俏皮而不无礼。封面应该引人注目。它是一个引人遐思的东西，而不是一篇专论。

In the end we doubled down, with a white pair of briefs on a white background. This image is cheeky rather than offensive. A cover is supposed to grab the eye. It’s a teaser, not a treatise.

普京将在3月17日的俄罗斯选举中获胜，这是一场虚假的选举——一场例行公推。但这应该成为西方的一声警钟。俄罗斯政权并未崩溃，而是表现出了强大的韧性。普京的野心构成了一个远远超出乌克兰范畴的长期威胁。尽管如此，西方仍然没有俄罗斯战略。

The election that Vladimir Putin will win in Russia on March 17th is a sham—a ritual acclamation. But it should nonetheless be a wake-up call for the West. Far from collapsing, Russia’s regime has proved resilient. Mr Putin’s ambitions pose a long-term threat that goes far beyond Ukraine. Despite this, however, the West is still without a Russia strategy.

多年来，我们的封面上一直有很多熊的形象。这周的一个想法，仅仅是在一幅地图上描绘出令人不安的平行切口，就足以展示前方的危险。眼下的担忧是乌克兰的失败，之后可能是对摩尔多瓦和波罗的海国家的攻击；但普京的野心并不止步于此。俄罗斯可能会将核弹头送入太空。其无人机和网络战士使其能够向境外投射力量。其虚假信息产业传播谎言和混乱。这种有害结合已经使撒哈拉以南的国家动荡不安，并支持了叙利亚及中非的专制者。它也可能左右今年全球将会看到的众多选举。

Over the years our covers have featured a lot of bears. For one idea this week, gruesome, parallel gashes in a map were all we needed to depict the dangers ahead. The immediate worry is a defeat of Ukraine and, after that, attacks on neighbouring countries such as Moldova and the Baltic states; but that is not where Mr Putin’s ambitions end. Russia may put nuclear warheads into space. Its drones and cyber-warriors allow it to project force beyond its borders. Its disinformation industry spreads lies and confusion. This malign combination has destabilised countries in the Sahel and propped up despots in Syria and central Africa. It could also sway some of the plethora of elections the world will see this year.

或者，通过一个“俄罗斯内幕”的标题，我们可以集中关注普京对自己国民所造成的暴力。自1999年接管以来，他扼杀了俄罗斯的民主，特别是在2010年代，年轻的城市俄罗斯人发起大规模抗议后。教科书和媒体宣扬一种诱人的民族主义和俄罗斯受害者的叙事。国内异议已被扼杀。叛变者叶甫根尼·普里戈津被从天空中击落，普京最具魅力的政治对手阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼于2月在古拉格中遇害。

Or, by playing with a cover line of “Inside Russia”, we could focus on the violence Mr Putin is doing to his own people. Having taken over in 1999, he rolled back Russian democracy, especially after young, urban Russians staged mass protests in the 2010s. Textbooks and the media promote a seductive narrative of nationalism and Russian victimhood. Dissent at home has been strangled. The mutinous Yevgeny Prigozhin was blown from the sky and Mr Putin’s most charismatic political rival, Alexei Navalny, was murdered in the gulag in February.

许多西方人希望西方对俄制裁和普京在乌克兰犯的错误可能导致其政权的失败。然而，正如我们本周对[符拉迪沃斯托克](https://www.economist.com/interactive/europe/2024/03/13/vladivostok-is-a-window-into-wartime-russia)生活的研究所示，普京政权看起来很稳固。俄罗斯经济已经经过改组。石油出口绕过了制裁，并被运往全球南方。从宝马到H&M等西方品牌已被中国和本土替代。一个谨慎的工作假设是普京将长期执政。

Many in the West hoped that Western sanctions and Mr Putin’s blunders in Ukraine might doom his regime. Yet as our study this week of life in [Vladivostok](https://www.economist.com/interactive/europe/2024/03/13/vladivostok-is-a-window-into-wartime-russia) shows, it looks solid. Russia’s economy has been re-engineered. Oil exports bypass sanctions and are shipped to the global south. Western brands from BMW to H&M have been replaced with Chinese and local substitutes. A prudent working assumption is that Mr Putin will be in power for years.

我们认为对外侵略与对内镇压是一种冲动的两个方面。普京将西方归咎于对其统治的挑战，并试图通过排斥西方影响，把俄罗斯人团结在一起，与美国和北约的夸大形象作斗争，以保护其政权。无论在国内还是在国外，当言语无济于事时，他将使用恐惧或暴力。

We believe that outward aggression and inward repression are part of the same impulse. Mr Putin blames the West for challenges to his rule, and seeks to safeguard his regime by shutting out Western influence and trying to unite the Russian people in a struggle against a caricature of America and NATO. At home and abroad, when words fail, he will use fear or violence.

这些令人沮丧的想法引导我们选择了这张红场的照片。你看到它仿佛穿过一个失色的隧道。圣瓦西里大教堂矗立在鹅卵石上方。一对绷紧神情的夫妇手牵手走远离相机—看起来，并不是因为爱，而更多是为了安慰。

Those gloomy thoughts led us to this photograph of Red Square. You see it as if through a tunnel, drained of colour. St Basil’s Cathedral looms over the cobblestones. A tense, silhouetted couple walk away from the camera holding hands—not, it seems, out of love so much as for consolation.

政治 (Politics)
==========

狐狸守着鸡舍 (A fox guarding the hen house)
----------------------------------

![前警察官Jimmy“烧烤”Cherizier在太子港媒体前发表讲话](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_WWP002.jpg)

在新的执政委员会成立后，阿里尔·亨利同意辞去海地总理职务。亨利先生已经数周不在海地。在他缺席期间，海地变得更加混乱，武装团伙如今掌握实际权力，肆意游荡。著名武装团伙领袖Jimmy“烧烤”Chérizier（上图）曾呼吁亨利先生下台。早些时候，美国撤离了大部分驻太子港大使馆人员。

Ariel Henry agreed to step down as prime minister of [**Haiti**](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/03/14/haiti-is-locked-in-a-doom-loop-of-insecurity-and-illegitimacy) once a new governing council is in place. Mr Henry has been out of the country for several weeks. In his absence Haiti became even more chaotic, with armed gangs, who now wield the real power, roaming at will. Jimmy “Barbecue” Chérizier (above), a prominent gang leader, had called for Mr Henry to go. Earlier America evacuated most of its embassy staff from Port-au-Prince.

**委内瑞拉**政府宣布逮捕另一名著名反对派成员。该政府声称Emill Brandt Ulloa参与了暴力抗议活动并侮辱了一名官员。被禁止参加7月总统选举的主要反对派领袖玛丽亚·科里娜·马查多表示，Brandt先生已被“绑架”。

The **Venezuelan** government announced the arrest of another prominent opposition member. It claims that Emill Brandt Ulloa had taken part in violent protests and insulted an official. María Corina Machado, the main opposition leader, who has been banned from running in July’s presidential election, said Mr Brandt had been “kidnapped”.

从2014年到2022年担任**洪都拉斯**总统的胡安·奥兰多·埃尔南德斯被纽约法院判定贩运可卡因罪成。埃尔南德斯的竞选承诺打击毒品团伙。在任期间，洪都拉斯从美国获得了超过5000万美元用于其禁毒战争。他的妻子正竞选2025年总统。

Juan Orlando Hernández, president of **Honduras** from 2014 to 2022, was found guilty by a court in New York of trafficking cocaine. Mr Hernández’s election campaign promised to crack down on narcotic gangs. While he was in office Honduras received more than $50m from America towards his war on drugs. His wife is running for president in 2025.

**以色列**和哈马斯未能达成协议，该协议原本将释放加薩地带尚存的一些人质，以换取一项临时停火和释放数百名巴勒斯坦囚犯。谈判人士原本希望在斋月（穆斯林斋月）开始之前敲定协议。乔·拜登暗示，若以色列超越“红线”入侵拉法，即位于加薩南部、许多巴勒斯坦人正在避难的城市，美国可能限制其武器供应。

**Israel** and Hamas [failed to reach a deal](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/14/hopes-for-a-truce-in-gaza-give-way-to-fears-of-a-long-stalemate) that would have seen the release of some of the remaining hostages in **Gaza** in exchange for a temporary ceasefire and the freeing of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Negotiators had hoped that an agreement could be finalised before the start of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting. Joe Biden suggested that an invasion of Rafah, the city in southern Gaza where many Palestinians are now sheltering, was a “red line” and seemed to imply that America could limit its supply of weapons if Israel crossed it.

拜登宣布，美国将在加沙沿海建造一个码头，以便提供更多量的**人道主义援助**。另外，一艘装载180吨食物的船只已从塞浦路斯出发。这是自哈马斯2007年控制沿海地带以来首艘获准向加薩地帶提供援助的船只。

Mr Biden announced that America will build a pier off the coast of Gaza to enable the delivery of far greater quantities of **humanitarian aid**. Separately a boat bringing 180 tonnes of food left Cyprus. It is the first ship authorised to deliver aid to Gaza since Hamas took control of the coastal strip in 2007.

据救助儿童组织称，**苏丹**几乎有300万名儿童处于急性营养不良状态，将在未来几个月有将近23万名儿童、孕妇和新母亲面临死亡危险，急需援助。根据联合国的数据，自去年四月爆发的内战已经导致全球最严重的人道危机，800万苏丹人被迫离家。

Almost 3m children in **Sudan** are acutely malnourished and nearly 230,000 children, pregnant women and new mothers may die in the coming months without urgent aid, according to Save the Children. A civil war that erupted last April has caused the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis, with 8m Sudanese forced from their homes, according to the UN.

最近几周已有300多名学生从**尼日利亚**的学校被绑架。自2014年以来，已有超过1400名学生被绑架。

More than 300 pupils have been abducted from schools in **Nigeria** in recent weeks. In all more than 1,400 pupils have been kidnapped since 2014.

驻扎在**乌克兰**的一些自称为俄罗斯的战斗团体声称已经进行了越境袭击进入**俄罗斯**境内，以将克里姆林宫部队从前线转移。这些战斗团体声称反对弗拉基米尔·普京—他的政府表示已将突袭击退。俄罗斯还不得不抵御一波乌克兰的无人机袭击，其中一些目标瞄准了炼油厂。

Groups of fighters who are based in **Ukraine** but claim to be Russian said they had conducted raids across the border into **Russia** to draw Kremlin troops away from the front line. The fighters say they oppose Vladimir Putin—his government said it had repelled the assault. Russia also had to defend itself against a wave of Ukrainian drone attacks, some of which targeted oil refineries.

与此同时，据报道，俄罗斯海军司令被解雇。乌克兰针对俄罗斯**黑海**舰队的进攻效果非常显著。美国认为在过去六个月内，乌克兰已击沉15艘俄罗斯船只。

Meanwhile the head of the Russian navy was reportedly sacked. Ukraine’s offensive against Russia’s **Black Sea** fleet has been highly effective. America thinks Ukraine has sunk 15 Russian ships over the past six months alone.

尽管如此，美国中央情报局长和美国国家情报总监表示，俄罗斯在**乌克兰战争**中处于上风，已增加了炮弹生产，并确保了无人机供应。这些官员表示，一项旨在向乌克兰提供援助的美国援助计划目前在国会陷入僵局，将使乌克兰能够守住前线。

Nevertheless, the head of the CIA and the director of US national intelligence said that Russia was gaining the upper hand in the **war in Ukraine**, had increased its production of artillery shells and secured a supply of drones. The officials said that an American aid package to Ukraine, which is stalled in Congress, would enable it to hold the front line.

![葡萄牙民主联盟（AD）领袖路易斯·蒙腾内格罗庆祝胜利](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_WWP001.jpg)

[**葡萄牙**](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/11/portugals-hard-right-gets-a-big-election-boost)在一次大选中右转。中右翼民主联盟赢得了议会中的绝大多数席位，但未获得多数席位。社会党失去了43席，将他们推到第二位。成立于2019年的右翼民粹主义政党Chega以18%的得票率获得第三名，获得48个议席。民主联盟领袖路易斯·蒙腾内格罗表示，他不会请求Chega帮助组建政府。

**[Portugal](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/11/portugals-hard-right-gets-a-big-election-boost)** took a turn towards the right at a general election. The centre-right Democratic Alliance won the most seats in parliament but fell short of a majority. The Socialists lost 43 seats, pushing them into second place. Chega, a right-wing populist party formed in 2019, came third with 18% of the vote, giving it 48 deputies. Luís Montenegro, the DA’s leader, has said he will not ask Chega for help in forming a government.

吉尔特·维尔德斯承认自己不会成为**荷兰**总理，因为四个月后的选举仍在继续组建政府。维尔德斯先生领导的极右翼自由党在选举中赢得最多席位，仍希望成为新右翼联盟的一部分。

Geert Wilders conceded that he would not become prime minister of the **Netherlands** as talks continued to form a government, four months after an election. Mr Wilders’s far-right Party for Freedom (pvv) won the most seats in the poll and still wants to be part of a new right-wing coalition.

**爱尔兰**选民以压倒性优势否决了宪法关于家庭和妇女角色的两项修正案。第一个修正案试图将婚姻作为家庭基础改变为包括“持久关系”。第二个修正案旨在删除有关妇女在家中提供照顾的参考。反对双方认为，宪法的变更文本很令人困惑，并将排除非家庭成员在对“照顾者”进行新定义时被包括在内。

Voters in **Ireland** overwhelmingly rejected two amendments to the constitution on family and the role of women. The first amendment sought to change marriage as the basis on which a family is founded to one that includes “durable relationships”. The second wanted to scrap a reference to a woman providing care within the home. Opponents to both amendments maintained that the replacement wording to the constitution was confusing, and would have excluded non-family members in a new definition of “caregivers”.

埃马纽埃尔·马克龙表示支持一项法案，该法案将为希望自己死亡和帮助他人死亡的人在法律中确立权利。这位**法国**总统表示，这项法案将在五月份由国民议会辩论，将采用“协助死亡”一词，而非辅助自杀。

Emmanuel Macron said he supported a bill that would enshrine rights in law for people who want to die and for those who help them. The **French** president said the bill, which the national assembly will debate in May, would refer to “aid in dying”, rather than assisted suicide.

英格兰的卫生服务部门确认，他们将不再常规性地开具**青春期阻滞剂**处方，经过多项研究的审查后得出结论，没有足够证据消除安全担忧。他们已决定，对患有性别疑惑的儿童和年轻人开具青春期阻滞剂只能在研究项目中提供。

England’s health service confirmed that it would no longer routinely prescribe **puberty blockers** following a review of a number of studies. It concluded that there was not enough evidence to allay safety concerns. It has decided that access to the blockers for children and young people with gender dysphoria should be available only in research programmes.

**泰国**选举委员会向改革派政党Move Forward发出首个取缔律师函，该政党在去年的选举中名列第一，但被皇室主义势力阻止执政。这个委员会依据宪法法院的裁决表示，Move Forward试图修改该国禁止批评君主的法律是非法的。

**Thailand’s** Election Commission took the first legal step towards banning Move Forward, a reformist party that came first in last year’s election but was blocked from taking power by the royalist establishment. The commission bases its reasoning on a ruling by the Constitutional Court, which held that Move Forward’s aim of changing the country’s *lèse-majesté* laws, which forbid any criticism of the monarchy, was illegal.

**印度**政府实施了一项引起争议的法律，简化了邻国某些宗教少数群体的取得公民身份的途径，但排除了穆斯林。在2015年之前从阿富汗、孟加拉国或巴基斯坦逃往印度的印度教徒、锡克教徒、基督徒等将获得公民身份。例如，来自缅甸的罗边族穆斯林无法申请。政府否认这项法律是歧视性的。

The government in **India** implemented a [controversial law](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/03/14/indias-government-implements-a-controversial-citizenship-law) that eases the path to citizenship for members of some religious minorities from neighbouring countries but excludes Muslims. Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and others who fled to India from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan before 2015 will be granted citizenship. Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, for example, cannot apply. The government denies that the law is discriminatory.

乔·拜登和唐纳德·特朗普在最新一轮初选中赢得了足够的**代表**票，确保了他们各自政党的总统提名。特朗普控制**共和党**正式完成，他的支持者当选为共和国全国委员会的领导角色。密切盟友迈克尔·瓦特利成为该党新任主席。艾瑞克·特朗普之妻、特朗普的儿子之一的拉拉·特朗普成为副主席。在这些任命发布后，约60名共和党全国委员会工作人员立即被清除。

Joe Biden and Donald Trump both won enough **delegates** in the latest batch of primaries to secure their parties’ nomination for president. Mr Trump’s takeover of the **Republican Party** was formalised with the election of his champions to leadership roles on the Republican National Committee. Michael Whatley, a key ally, is the party’s new chairman. Lara Trump, the wife of Eric Trump, one of Mr Trump’s sons, is his deputy. Around 60 RNC staff were purged immediately after the appointments were made.

好的结局是一切的。 (All’s well that ends well)
----------------------------------

美国众议院通过了一项法案，该法案要求中国公司字节跳动，即拥有**[TikTok](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/12/time-for-tiktok-to-cut-its-ties-to-china)**的公司，要么出售该平台，要么停止在美国运营，而美国是TikTok最大的市场。该法案的支持者担心中国可能会施加压力于TikTok，以调整内容使其符合其喜好。TikTok因其古怪的视频剪辑而变得受欢迎，但已经发展成为一个大型的事实媒体提供者。三分之一的美国30岁以下成年人使用它来获取新闻。该法案现在将提交给参议院。

America’s House of Representatives passed a bill which would require ByteDance, the Chinese firm that owns **[TikTok](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/12/time-for-tiktok-to-cut-its-ties-to-china)**, either to sell the platform or to stop operating in America, TikTok’s biggest market. The bill’s supporters worry that China could lean on TikTok to massage content to its liking. TikTok became popular with its quirky video clips, but has morphed into a big provider of factual media. A third of American adults under 30 use it to catch up on the news. The bill now goes to the Senate.

**Sam Altman**被恢复到OpenAI董事会。去年11月，Altman先生被前一届董事会解雇为首席执行官，但在员工和投资者的反叛之后，迅速恢复了这一职务。对这些事件的独立审查得出结论，称前一届董事会与Altman先生之间存在“关系失控和信任丧失”。

**Sam Altman** was restored to the board at OpenAI. Mr Altman was sacked as chief executive by the previous board last November but swiftly reinstated in that job following a revolt by employees and investors. An independent review into those events has concluded that there was a “breakdown in the relationship and loss of trust” between the prior board and Mr Altman.

**[沙特阿美](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/11/is-saudi-aramco-cooling-on-crude-oil)**报告显示，截至2023年，其净利润为1,210亿美元，超过了西方五家最大石油公司的总利润。沙特阿美增加了其红利支出至980亿美元，这是沙特国家的一个重要收入来源，并承诺今年将提高支付金额。

**[Saudi Aramco](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/11/is-saudi-aramco-cooling-on-crude-oil)** reported a net profit of $121bn for 2023, more than the combined profits of the West’s five biggest oil companies. Aramco increased its dividend pay-out to $98bn, a big source of income for the Saudi state, and promised even higher payments this year.

美国二月份**通胀**率略微上升至3.2%。另外数据显示，上个月美国雇主新增了27.5万个**工作**岗位。尽管这比预期的多，但是1月份爆炸式增长的35.3万个新工作岗位被修正为22.9万个。这两组数据都没有改变投资者对美联储将于6月开始加息的预期。

America’s annual rate of **inflation** rose slightly in February, to 3.2%. Separate data showed that American employers created 275,000 **jobs** last month. Although that was more than expected, January’s red-hot figure of 353,000 new jobs was revised down to 229,000. Neither set of figures changed investors’ expectations that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates in June.

在**阿根廷**，二月份的年度通货膨胀率再次激增至276%。但价格的环比增长率从1月份的21%降至13%。阿根廷总统哈维尔·米雷伊着手进行他自认为痛苦的经济改革。联合国儿童基金会警告称，70%的阿根廷儿童可能生活在贫困中。与此同时，政府将到期的价值500亿美元的债务延期到明年，这是阿根廷历史上最大规模的债务置换。央行将基准利率从100%下调至80%。

In **Argentina** the annual rate of inflation surged again, to 276% in February. But the month-on-month increase in prices slowed to 13%, from 21% in January. Javier Milei, the country’s president, has embarked on economic reforms that he acknowledges are painful. UNICEF has warned that 70% of Argentine children could be living in poverty. Meanwhile, the government rolled over $50bn-worth of debt that was to mature this year for securities that are due next year, the largest debt-swap in Argentina’s history.

法国将其在2019年至2023年全球**军火出口**市场的份额从2014年至2018年的7.2%增加到11%，根据斯德哥尔摩国际和平研究所的数据。法国通过向印度等国家出售更多武器而获益，占去了俄罗斯的一部分生意。俄罗斯在全球市场份额从21%下降到11%。

France increased its share of the **global arms-export** market to 11% in 2019-23 from 7.2% in 2014-18, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. France gained by selling more weapons to countries such as India, the world’s biggest arms importer, taking some of Russia’s business. Russia’s share of the global market dropped to 11% from 21%.

社交媒体平台**Reddit**将于3月21日在纽约上市，据彭博报道。Reddit希望筹集将近7.5亿美元，这可能是今年迄今为止最大的IPO之一。

**Reddit**, a social-media platform, will float its shares in New York on March 21st, according to Bloomberg. Reddit hopes to raise nearly $750m, which could be one of the biggest IPOs so far this year.

**苹果**表示将允许开发者在欧盟销售可下载到iPhone的应用程序，无需使用其App Store。这是对欧洲监管机构的一个重大让步；新数字市场法案本月生效。开发者仍需遵守苹果严格的安全标准，并且在其开发者计划中保持“良好地位”的成员至少两年。

**Apple** said it would allow developers to sell apps in the European Union for download onto an iPhone without having to use its App Store. It is a big concession to European regulators; a new Digital Markets Act came into force this month. Developers will still have to comply with Apple’s stringent safety standards, and be a “member of good standing” in its developer programme for at least two years.

中国一家最大的智能手机制造商加速向电动汽车业务转型。**小米**将于3月28日推出其SU7轿车，很快将开始交付。该汽车仅在中国销售。它将加入一个竞争激烈的市场；现有的电动汽车制造商已开始另一轮降价以吸引买家。

One of China’s biggest smartphone-makers accelerated its move into the electric-vehicle business. **Xiaomi** is launching its SU7 sedan on March 28th, with the first deliveries taking place soon after. The car will be available only in China. It will join a crowded market; existing EV-makers have started another round of price cuts to entice buyers.

**国泰航空**报告显示，其2021年将净利润为980亿港元（125亿美元），这是自2019年以来的首次增长，也是2010年以来的最高值。由于香港直到2022年底才解除的大流行病措施，这家香港航空公司落后于大多数其他国际航空公司返负盈利。它预计明年第一季度将恢复到提供百分之百的疫情前航班。

**Cathay Pacific** reported an annual net profit of HK$9.8bn ($1.25bn), its first since 2019 and its biggest since 2010. The Hong Kong airline lagged behind most other international carriers in returning to post-covid profitability because of the pandemic measures that the city lifted at only the end of 2022. It expects to return to providing 100% of its pre-pandemic flights in the first quarter of next year.

**阿迪达斯**则宣布30年来首次出现年度净亏损。德国运动服装公司表示，北美销售下降了16%，部分原因是“耶齐负面影响”。阿迪达斯因2022年前卫的反犹太言论与之前的Kanye West断绝关系。但公司一直在出售Ye品牌产品的库存，这些产品仍很受欢迎。

By contrast, **Adidas** posted its first annual net loss in 30 years. Sales in North America dropped by 16%, in part because of the “negative Yeezy impact”, according to the German sportswear company. Adidas cut its ties with Ye, formerly Kanye West, over his antisemitic remarks in 2022. But it has been selling off its inventory of Ye-branded products, which are still popular.

英国国家统计办公室更新了用于计算**通货膨胀**的商品和服务篮子。随着消费者**口味**的改变，新增内容包括黑胶唱片（根据通常严肃的数字大量计算者，“唱片复兴”）、气炸锅（在销售中“烹饪风暴”）和无麸质面包。消失的则有洗手液、沙发床和烤盘。

Britain’s Office of National Statistics updated the basket of goods and services that it uses to calculate inflation. Reflecting the changing **tastes of consumers**, new additions include vinyl albums (“a record revival”, according to the normally humourless number-crunchers), air fryers (which are “cooking up a storm” in sales) and gluten-free bread. Out go such things as hand sanitisers, sofa beds and roasting tins.

海湾对非洲的争夺正在重塑这块大陆 (The Gulf’s scramble for Africa is reshaping the continent)
=========================================================================

其增强影响力带来经济回报和政治风险 (Its increased influence brings economic rewards and political risks)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![谢赫穆罕默德·本·扎耶德·阿勒纳哈扬与埃塞俄比亚总理阿比·艾哈迈德在阿布扎比会晤](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_LDP504.jpg)

在冷战期间，非洲领导人常常选择站在西方或苏联一边，从中获取援助、军火、投资和其他所需之物。冷战结束后，那些想要建造道路和港口的人通常与中国达成交易。如今，非洲政客们如同地缘政治市场中的顾客，中间性力量——包括巴西、印度和土耳其——扩展着他们的经济和外交影响力。然而，阿联酋（**UAE**）的崛起——以及相对较小程度上的沙特阿拉伯和卡塔尔——尤为引人注目。海湾国家对非洲的争夺承诺带来巨大的经济利益，但也威胁着引发可怕的战争。

During the cold war African leaders often sided with the West or the Soviet Union, extracting from them aid, arms, investment and other things they desired. After it ended, those wanting to build roads and ports generally did deals with China. Today African politicians are like customers in a geopolitical bazaar as middle powers—including Brazil, India and Turkey—extend their economic and diplomatic reach. Yet it is the rise of the United Arab Emirates (UAE)—and to a lesser extent Saudi Arabia and Qatar—that is the most striking. The Gulf’s [scramble for Africa](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/13/gulf-countries-are-becoming-major-players-in-africa) promises great economic benefits, but also threatens to fuel horrific wars.

海湾地区影响力来自资金。去年11月，沙特阿拉伯举办了首次非洲峰会，宣布数十亿美元的投资。即便如此，这一数字也远远不及阿联酋，2022年，阿联酋对非洲的投资承诺是美国公司的七倍。在之前的十年中，阿联酋是非洲第四大外国直接投资者，仅次于中国、欧盟和美国。总部位于迪拜的DP World公司在九个非洲国家经营港口。可再生能源公司Masdar表示将在非洲投入100亿美元。2020年和2021年，阿联酋与撒哈拉以南非洲的贸易额超过了与美国的贸易额。迪拜以其稳定的产权和宽松（有人说是宽松）的金融监管，拥有超过26,000家非洲企业。

Gulf influence stems from cash. In November Saudi Arabia held its first Africa summit, at which it announced billions of dollars of investment. Even that is dwarfed by the UAE, which in 2022 made investment pledges in Africa worth seven times those of American firms. In the previous ten years it was the fourth-largest foreign direct investor in Africa, behind China, the EU and America. DP World, a Dubai-based firm, runs ports in nine African countries. Masdar, a renewables firm, says it will splurge $10bn in Africa. In 2020 and 2021 the UAE traded more with sub-Saharan Africa than America did. Dubai, with its secure property rights and light (some would say lax) financial regulation, is home to over 26,000 African businesses.

外交与资金并驾齐驱。去年，阿联酋和沙特阿拉伯获邀参加布里克斯国家组织的峰会。卡塔尔和阿联酋将它们在撒哈拉以南非洲的大使馆数量从2012年至2022年增加了五倍和近三倍。沙特阿拉伯承诺开设大约十几个新的驻外机构。全球2022年新开设的大使馆中有三分之一位于海湾地区，很大程度上是由互惠的非洲外交所驱动的。

Diplomacy comes in concert with the money. The uae and Saudi Arabia were invited to join the brics at the bloc’s summit last year in Johannesburg. Qatar and the UAE increased the number of their embassies in sub-Saharan Africa five-fold and nearly three-fold, respectively, from 2012 to 2022. Saudi Arabia has promised to open a dozen or so more posts. One-third of all new embassies opened globally in 2022 were in the Gulf, driven largely by reciprocal African diplomacy.

这种关注将为面临资金困难的非洲国家带来好处。中国对非洲的新贷款在截至2022年的四年间下降了80%。由于乌克兰战争的原因，西方援助对非洲的比例有所下降。一些西方官员希望海湾国家可以填补这一缺口，并帮助他们抵御主要地缘政治竞争对手，通过将投资引导到可能最终落入中国手中的矿产项目中。

The attention will bring benefits to African states facing a funding squeeze. New Chinese loans granted to Africa slumped by 80% in the four years to 2022 over the preceding four. Africa’s share of Western aid has declined because of the war in Ukraine. Some Western officials hope Gulf countries can fill the gap and help them see off their main geopolitical rival by [channelling investment into mines](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/13/gulf-countries-are-becoming-major-players-in-africa) that might otherwise end up in Chinese hands.

然而，将非洲转变为海湾国家雄心和 rivalries 的舞台存在巨大风险。海湾地区的家族专制政权既不是非洲民主的捍卫者，也不是人权的捍卫者。中国也不是，尽管至少倾向于稳定，并一直是联合国维和行动的主要金融支持者。相比之下，阿联酋是一颗不定时炸弹，支持武装军阀，制造混乱，并为腐败的精英提供庇护。

Yet turning Africa into an arena for the ambitions and rivalries of Gulf powers carries huge risks. The Gulf’s dynastic autocracies are neither champions of African democracy nor of human rights. Nor is China, though it at least tends to prize stability and has been a big financial supporter of UN peacekeeping operations. The UAE, by contrast, is a loose cannon that arms warlords, spreads chaos and provides a haven for corrupt elites.

以苏丹为例，阿联酋支持了快速支援部队（**RSF**），一个进行内战反对国家军队的种族灭绝民兵。这是世界上最大的人道主义危机，大约有2,500万人需要援助。尽管阿联酋否认向**RSF**提供武器（联合国认为这些指控“可信”），但它似乎正在与强人网络结盟，有时候甚至提供武器，作为海湾国家在该地区争夺影响力的一部分。阿联酋的朋友包括 RSF 领导人穆罕默德（“赫姆德蒂”）达加洛、利比亚军阀哈夫塔尔、查德政变上台的马哈马德·德比以及将埃塞俄比亚引入提格雷血腥内战的阿比·艾哈迈德。

Exhibit A is Sudan, where the UAE has backed the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a genocidal militia, which is waging a civil war against the national army. It is the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with about 25m people in need of aid. The UAE, which denies arming the RSF (the UN deems the allegations “credible”), seems to be courting a network of strongmen—sometimes with arms—as part of a contest for influence in the region between the Gulf states. Among the UAE’s friends are Muhammad (“Hemedti”) Dagalo, the RSF’s leader; Khalifa Haftar, a warlord in Libya; Mahamat Déby, who took power in a coup in Chad; and Abiy Ahmed, who has led Ethiopia into a bloody civil war in Tigray.

石油和天然气财富意味着阿联酋、沙特阿拉伯和卡塔尔将成为未来数年中令人向往的富有伙伴。但从苏丹和利比亚传播出的动荡波及的警示：西方必须意识到将其非洲政策外包给不分享其价值观的国家的危险；非洲国家应明白让自己被他人的地缘政治游戏牵制的风险。■

Oil and natural-gas wealth mean that the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar will be [enticingly rich partners for years](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2024/03/11/oils-endgame-will-be-in-the-gulf). But the ripples of mayhem spreading from Sudan and Libya offer a warning: the West must see the danger of outsourcing its Africa policies to countries that do not share its values; and African countries should know the risks of letting themselves be used as pawns in someone else’s geopolitical games.■

俄罗斯流氓威胁全世界，不只是乌克兰 (Rogue Russia threatens the world, not just Ukraine)
===================================================================

西方必须明确敌人是弗拉基米尔·普京，而不是1.43亿普通俄罗斯人 (The West must show its enemy is Vladimir Putin, not 143m ordinary Russians)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![华纳兄弟漫威影片在全美内地的票房冠军](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_LDD002_FH.jpg)

就像他自比的沙皇一样，弗拉基米尔·普京即将再次被封为俄罗斯的统治者，任期为六年。他将在**3月17日**赢得的[选举](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/12/russians-go-to-the-polls-in-a-sham-election-for-their-president)是一场骗局。但这应该对西方构成一个警钟。俄罗斯政权的坚韧表现出其具有韧性。普京先生的野心构成了一个远非乌克兰问题的长期威胁。他可能在非洲和中东制造更多纷争，削弱联合国，并将核武器部署到太空中。西方需要制定一个长期战略，应对违背规则的俄罗斯，这远不及只是帮助[乌克兰](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis)那样简单。但目前西方并没有这样的战略。同时，它还需要展示，它的敌人是普京先生，而不是1.43亿俄罗斯人民。

Like the tsar he models himself on, Vladimir Putin is about to be anointed as Russia’s ruler for another six years. The [election he will win on March 17th](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/12/russians-go-to-the-polls-in-a-sham-election-for-their-president) will be a sham. But it should nonetheless be a wake-up call for the West. Far from collapsing, Russia’s regime has proved resilient. And Mr Putin’s ambitions pose a long-term threat that goes far beyond Ukraine. He could spread more discord in Africa and the Middle East, cripple the un and put nuclear weapons in space. The West needs a long-term strategy for a rogue Russia that goes much further than helping [Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis). Right now it doesn’t have one. It also needs to show that its enemy is Mr Putin, not 143m Russian people.

许多西方人希望西方的制裁和普京在乌克兰犯下的错误，包括毫无意义地牺牲大批年轻俄罗斯人，可能会使他的政权走向失败。然而，它却幸存了下来。正如我们本周对**符拉迪沃斯托克**生活的研究显示的那样，俄罗斯的韧性有几个基础。俄罗斯经济已被重新调整。石油出口绕过制裁，向全球南部运送。从宝马到h&m的西方品牌已被中国和本地替代品取代。在教科书和媒体中，民族主义和俄罗斯受害者的诱人叙事被宣传。国内的异见已被扼杀。普京最具魅力的政治对手，亚历克谢·纳瓦尔尼，于二月在古拉格中被谋杀。到目前为止，克里姆林宫对控制悼念他的勇敢人群毫无困难。

Many in the West hoped that Western sanctions and Mr Putin’s blunders in Ukraine, including the senseless sacrifice of legions of young Russians, might doom his regime. Yet it survived. As our study this week of life in [Vladivostok](https://www.economist.com/interactive/europe/2024/03/13/vladivostok-is-a-window-into-wartime-russia) shows, its resilience has several foundations. Russia’s economy has been re-engineered. Oil exports bypass sanctions and are shipped to the global south. Western brands from bmw to h&m have been replaced with Chinese and local substitutes. In textbooks and the media a seductive narrative of nationalism and Russian victimhood is promulgated. Dissent at home has been strangled. Mr Putin’s most charismatic political rival, Alexei Navalny, was murdered in the gulag in February. So far the Kremlin has had no difficulty controlling the brave crowds mourning him.

随着时间推移，这个政权将面临新的脆弱性。被切断与西方技术往来的累积效应将拖累生产率：想想波音飞机的磨损，或者依赖盗版软件。俄罗斯对中国的依赖可能会成为一个弱点。经济的军事化将损害生活水平。在未来二十年内，人口将减少大约十分之一。随着71岁的普京年龄增长，接班的斗争将逐渐浮出水面。预测一个暴君何时会垮台总是困难的。然而，一个审慎的工作假设是，普京先生将掌权多年。

Over time the regime will face new vulnerabilities. The cumulative effects of being cut off from Western technologies will be a drag on productivity: think of wear-and-tear on Boeing planes, or having to rely on pirated software. Russia’s increasing dependence on China may become a weakness. The militarisation of the economy will hurt living standards. The population will shrink by a tenth or so in the next two decades. And as the 71-year-old Mr Putin ages, a succession struggle will loom. It is always hard to predict when a tyrant will fall. However, a prudent working assumption is that Mr Putin will be in power for years.

在冷战期间，苏联对自由世界构成了军事和意识形态上的威胁。西方成功遏制了它，并在它崩溃后欢迎了其民主和市场改革。接手于1999年的普京逐渐消解了俄罗斯的民主制度，在最初缓慢的基础上，在2010年代城市年轻俄罗斯人发起大规模抗议后加快了速度。他将他统治面临的挑战归咎于西方，并试图通过封锁西方影响并团结俄罗斯人民来确保他的政权，共同对抗美国和北约的夸大形象。如今，俄罗斯仅拥有中等规模的经济体，并没有一致的意识形态可以输出。然而，它构成了一个全球威胁。眼下的直接危险是乌克兰的失败，之后可能是对摩尔多瓦和波罗的海国家等邻国的攻击；但普京的野心并非止于此。

During the cold war, the Soviet Union posed both a military and an ideological threat to the free world. The West successfully contained it and, after it collapsed, welcomed its democratic and market reforms. Mr Putin, who took over in 1999, has rolled back Russian democracy, slowly at first, but more rapidly after young, urban Russians staged mass protests in the 2010s. He blames the West for challenges to his rule, and seeks to safeguard his regime by trying to shut out Western influence and unite the Russian people in a struggle against a caricature of America and NATO. Today, Russia has only a medium-size economy and no coherent ideology to export. Yet it poses a global threat. The immediate danger is a defeat of Ukraine and, after that, attacks on neighbouring countries such as Moldova and those in the Baltics; but that is not where Mr Putin’s ambitions end.

考虑新型或非传统武器。据报道，俄罗斯正在尝试将核弹头送入太空。其无人机和网络战士使其能够在其边境之外施加力量。其错误信息工业传播谎言和混乱。这种有害组合已经动摇了撒哈拉以南国家的稳定，并支持了叙利亚和中非的专制者。它还可能影响今年世界将看到的众多选举之一。许多全球南方的人们相信俄罗斯的虚假叙事：普京正在拯救乌克兰免受纳粹的威胁，北约才是真正的侵略者，并且西方试图把其颓废的社会规范强加给其他所有人。不能低估俄罗斯削弱1945年后建立的全球机构，尤其是联合国安理会的能力。它已经变成了一个对自由世界秩序的虚无主义和不可预测的敌人，着眼于破坏和破坏。它就像是朝鲜或伊朗采取了类固醇，拥有数千枚核弹头。

Consider new or unconventional weapons. Russia is reported to be experimenting with putting nuclear warheads into space. Its drones and cyber-warriors allow it to project force beyond its borders. Its misinformation industry spreads lies and confusion. This malign combination has destabilised countries in the Sahel and propped up despots in Syria and central Africa. It could also sway some of the plethora of elections the world will see this year. Many in the global south believe Russia’s false narrative: that Mr Putin is saving Ukraine from Nazis, that NATO is the real aggressor and that the West seeks to foist its decadent social norms on everyone else. Russia’s ability to hobble the global institutions established after 1945, not least the UN Security Council, should not be underestimated. It has morphed into a nihilistic and unpredictable foe of the liberal world order, bent on disruption and sabotage. It is like North Korea or Iran on steroids, armed with thousands of nuclear warheads.

西方应该做什么？美国和欧洲押注于两种策略：捍卫乌克兰和制裁。武装和资助乌克兰的捍卫者仍然是阻止俄罗斯侵略最具成本效益的方式，但西方继续做到这一点的决心却令人无法接受地动摇。

What should the West do? America and Europe have bet on two strategies: defending Ukraine and sanctions. Arming and financing Ukraine’s defenders remains the most cost-effective way to thwart Russian aggression, yet the West’s resolve to keep doing so is scandalously wavering.

与此同时，制裁的效果没有人抱有希望那样有效。它们可能产生反效果，并成为避免艰难选择的借口。以人口计算，80%以上，以gdp计算，40%以上的世界未对其实施制裁，让俄罗斯可以自由贸易并削弱制裁的合法性。如果西方试图使用次级制裁迫使全世界遵守，这将适得其反，导致一些国家放弃美国主导的金融体系。从长远看，最可行的路径是更为谨慎：对与克里姆林宫关联的个人继续实施有针对性的制裁，并确保先进技术（仍然倾向于西方）对俄罗斯昂贵或根本无法获得。

Sanctions, meanwhile, have been less effective than hoped. They can be counter-productive, and an excuse to avoid hard choices. Over 80% of the world, measured by population, and 40% by gdp, is not enforcing them, letting Russia trade freely and undermining the sanctions’ perceived legitimacy. If the West tried to use secondary sanctions to force the world to comply, it would backfire, leading some countries to abandon the American-led financial system. In the long run the most plausible path is more modest: maintaining targeted sanctions on Kremlin-linked individuals and ensuring that advanced tech, which still tends to be Western, is expensive or impossible for Russia to obtain.

这意味着，一个有效的俄罗斯战略需要更加重视另外两个支柱。第一是军事发展以遏制俄罗斯进一步侵略。在欧洲，这个软肋非常明显。年度国防开支不到gdp的2%，如果唐纳德·特朗普重新赢得白宫，美国对北约的承诺可能会减弱。欧洲需要将国防支出至少提升到gdp的3%，并为可能出现更多孤立主义的美国做准备。

That means an effective Russia strategy needs to put more weight on two other pillars. The first is a military build-up to deter further Russian aggression. In Europe the weakness is glaring. Annual defence spending is less than 2% of gdp, and if Donald Trump wins back the White House, America’s commitment to nato may wither. Europe needs to spend at least 3% of its gdp on defence and prepare for a more isolationist Uncle Sam.

西方还需要动用其中一种最强大的武器：普世自由价值观。正是这些价值观，以及星球大战和美元，揭露了苏联极权体制的不人道性，从而促使其崩溃。西方外交必须努力对抗俄罗斯在全球南方传播的虚假信息。它还需要面向俄罗斯公民，而不是将他们视为社会局外人。这意味着强调人权侵犯，支持异见者，并欢迎希望逃离自己国家的俄罗斯人。这意味着通过促进真实新闻和信息流入俄罗斯，支持现代化的力量。这也意味着确保制裁中有人道主义例外，从医疗设备到教育资料。短期内，俄罗斯的精英或普通公民几乎没有机会推翻普京政权。但从长远来看，只有当俄罗斯人民有此愿望时，俄罗斯才会停止成为一个流氓国家。 ■

The West also needs to deploy one of its most powerful weapons: universal liberal values. It was these, as well as Star Wars and dollars, that helped bring down the Soviet regime by exposing the inhumanity of its totalitarian system. Western diplomacy must seek to counter Russian disinformation across the global south. It also needs to address Russian citizens rather than treat them as pariahs. That means highlighting human-rights abuses, supporting dissidents and welcoming Russians who want to flee their country. It means backing the forces of modernisation by promoting the flow of real news and information into Russia. And it means ensuring that there are humanitarian exceptions to sanctions, from medical kit to educational materials. In the short term there is little chance that Russia’s elite or its ordinary citizens will boot out Mr Putin’s regime. But in the long run Russia will stop being a rogue nation only if its people want it to. ■

美国非凡的经济继续挑战悲观主义者 (America’s extraordinary economy keeps defying the pessimists)
============================================================================

唐纳德·特朗普和乔·拜登都有危及经济的想法 (Both Donald Trump and Joe Biden have ideas that endanger it)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![一位由美国国旗组成的健美运动员的轮廓](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_LDD001_FH.jpg)

你不得不对美国的经济感到惊叹。不久以前，人们普遍认为它濒临衰退。然而，实际上，2023年的收盘比12个月前增长了近3％，成为有史以来世纪迄今一个繁荣的年份。而且它继续挑战预期。在今年年初，经济学家们一直在预测第一季度年化增长率为1％；而这一预测已经翻了一番。劳动力市场也状况良好。失业率已经连续25个月低于4％，这是50年来持续时间最长的一次。难怪大笨象使全世界都感到羞愧。自2019年底以来，美国经济以实际计算增长了近8％，是欧元区增长速度的两倍，日本的十倍。而英国几乎没有增长。

You have to marvel at America’s economy. Not long ago it was widely thought to be on the brink of recession. Instead it ended 2023 nearly 3% larger than 12 months earlier, having enjoyed one of the boomier years of the century so far. And it continues to defy expectations. At the start of this year, economists had been forecasting annualised growth in the first quarter of 1%; that prediction has since doubled. The labour market is in rude health, too. The unemployment rate has been below 4% for 25 consecutive months, the longest such spell in over 50 years. No wonder Uncle Sam is putting the rest of the world to shame. Since the end of 2019 the economy has grown by nearly 8% in real terms, more than twice as fast as the euro zone’s and ten times as quickly as Japan’s. Britain’s has barely grown at all.

考虑到许多可能导致经济衰退的因素，美国的扩张更加引人注目。随着美联储[对抗通货膨胀](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/03/has-america-really-escaped-inflation)，经济经历了自吉米·卡特在白宫时以来利率的最急剧上升。新冠肺炎大流行、与中国不断升级的贸易战以及对抗气候变化共同重塑了供应链、劳动市场和消费者偏好。而在[乌克兰](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis)和[加沙](https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas)的战争加剧了地缘政治紧张局势并加剧了全球贸易体系的压力。

America’s expansion is all the more striking when you consider the many things that could have killed it. As the Federal Reserve has [fought inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/03/has-america-really-escaped-inflation) the economy has endured the sharpest rise in interest rates since Jimmy Carter was in the White House. The covid-19 pandemic, an intensifying trade war with China and the fight against climate change have together reshaped supply chains, labour markets and consumer preferences. Wars in [Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis) and [Gaza](https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas) have aggravated geopolitical tensions and worsened the strains on the global trading system.

美国的出色表现更为引人瞩目，当你考虑到可能会导致其“命丧黄泉”的许多因素。尽管通货膨胀有所下降，但仍然坚挺地高于美联储的2％目标，这意味着美联储可能无法实现投资者对6月份开始降息的期望。同时，地缘政治紧张局势看起来可能会推动经济分崩离析。然而，最大的威胁却源自于去年11月的总统选举。无论是乔·拜登还是唐纳德·特朗普，看起来都不太可能在重返白宫后促进经济扩张。相反，他们的计划将置经济于危险之中。

Can America’s remarkable strength persist? Threats to growth still hang over the economy. The longer interest rates stay high, for instance, the more damage they could do. Although inflation has fallen, it remains sticky above the Fed’s 2% target, meaning that the Fed may be unable to fulfil investors’ hopes for interest-rate cuts starting in June. Geopolitical tensions, meanwhile, look likely to spur economic fragmentation. Yet the biggest threat of all stems from November’s presidential election. Neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump seems likely to nurture the economic expansion should they return to the White House. Instead, their plans would endanger it.

要理解这一点，可以考虑经济[非凡表现](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/03/14/americas-economy-has-escaped-a-hard-landing)的原因。其中一个关键支柱是慷慨的疫情刺激措施，占国内生产总值的26％，是富裕国家平均水平的两倍多。这种慷慨引发了通货膨胀，但也确保了快速增长：消费者尚未花尽他们在“刺激支票”中收到的现金。即使新冠危机过去了，政府继续借债。过去一年的基本赤字几乎占国内生产总值的8％。这在利率上升的同时支持了需求。

To understand this, consider the reasons for the economy’s [extraordinary performance](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/03/14/americas-economy-has-escaped-a-hard-landing). A key plank was generous pandemic stimulus, which at 26% of GDP was more than double the rich-world average. This largesse fuelled inflation but also ensured fast growth: consumers have yet to spend all the cash they received in “stimmy” cheques. Even as the covid crisis passed, the government continued to borrow away. The underlying deficit over the past year was nearly 8% of GDP. That supported demand even as rates went up.

强劲需求得到了增加供应的满足。由于劳动力参与率上升，但主要是由于移民增加，美国比2019年底多了4％的工人。外国出生的人口增加了440万人，这个数字可能低估了非法抵达的人数。扩大的劳动力市场被用于提高效益。美国灵活的劳动市场几乎肯定使其更容易适应一个不断变化的世界。

Strong demand has been met by growing supply. America has 4% more workers than it did at the end of 2019, thanks in part to rising workforce participation, but mainly owing to higher immigration. The foreign-born population is up by 4.4m, a figure which may undercount those who arrived illegally. And the expanding workforce is being put to productive use. America’s flexible labour market has almost certainly made it easier for the economy to adapt fast to a changing world.

其他长期的优势使美国能够在地缘政治动荡中应对。其庞大的内部市场鼓励创新，并意味着它不像较小的富裕经济体那样依赖外贸。由于2010年代页岩油热潮使美国成为净能源出口国，从而在总体上受益而不是受到困扰于重创欧洲人钱包的高能源价格影响。

Other long-standing strengths have made America enviably placed to cope with geopolitical tumult. Its vast internal market encourages innovation and means it depends less on foreign trade than smaller rich economies do. Because the shale boom of the 2010s made America a net energy exporter, it has in aggregate benefited rather than suffered from the high energy prices that hit the wallets of Europeans.

问题在于，现在不再能依赖于增长的各种要素。政客们可能会认为根据美国最近的成功来推断，并通过进一步的刺激来促进经济。但这是不可持续的。官方预测显示，今年美国将在支付债务利息方面的开支超过国防开支。进一步借贷的风险将在未来积累金融危机。

The trouble is that each of the ingredients for growth can no longer be relied upon. It may be tempting for politicians to extrapolate from America’s recent success and juice the economy with further stimulus. But that is becoming unsustainable. Official forecasts show that America will this year spend more on debt interest than national defence. More borrowing risks building up financial perils in the future.

同时，无论是[特朗普](https://www.economist.com/topics/donald-trump)还是[拜登](https://www.economist.com/topics/joe-biden)都怀有民粹主义和保护主义的本能，这只会损害美国的增长潜力。在每位总统的第一任期内，刺激带来的快速增长掩盖了这些政策的破坏性。然而，这一次，破坏将不再掩饰。

At the same time, both [Mr Trump](https://www.economist.com/topics/donald-trump) and [Mr Biden](https://www.economist.com/topics/joe-biden) harbour populist and protectionist instincts that will only harm America’s growth potential. The sugar-rush of stimulus helped mask the damaging effects of such policies during each president’s first term. This time, however, the damage will not be disguised.

特朗普构成了更严重的威胁。他曾提倡对进口商品实行全面10％的关税，而一些顾问则认为这只是一个起点。这将使美国对商品进口的现有关税增加三倍，加剧通货膨胀，并提高制造商进口零部件的成本。与此同时，特朗普承诺大规模驱逐非法移民。这不仅仅是为了保护边境免受新的非法入境者，而是对劳动力供应构成风险：在2021年，美国1050万非法移民占其劳动力的约5％。

Mr Trump poses the graver threat. He has entertained a blanket 10% tariff on imports, which some of his advisers see as a mere starting-point. That would triple America’s existing levies on goods imports, worsen inflation and raise the cost of imported parts for manufacturers. At the same time, Mr Trump has promised the mass deportation of illegal immigrants. This goes well beyond trying to secure the border against new unauthorised entrants—a reasonable goal—and poses a risk to the labour supply: in 2021 America’s 10.5m irregular migrants made up an estimated 5% of its workforce.

拜登政府的威胁也同样严重。拜登让美联储继续对抗通货膨胀，并希望通过增加税收来减少赤字。但他同时也是一位经济民族主义者。他在3月7日的联合国发言中充斥着保护主义的承诺，政府将“购买美国货”，以及控制从住房到夹心巧克力等各种商品的价格的国家主义思想。

A Trump presidency would also threaten the Fed’s independence. Mr Trump says he would not reappoint its chairman, Jerome Powell, whose term expires in 2026, and whom he often criticised when in office. A pliant Fed at a time of big deficits—which Mr Trump might increase with more tax cuts—could threaten America’s macroeconomic stability.

无论拜登还是特朗普，他们都怀有对20世纪50年代和60年代一种错误的怀旧情绪，并将今天的经济描绘得比实际更弱。特朗普认为贸易和移民使这个国家变得更贫穷；拜登对大企业深表不信任。而当他们承认美国的优势时，两人都归因于自己错误的干预主义。事实上，他们正在逐渐破坏那些是这个国家财富的终极来源的自由市场。

A second Biden term promises nothing as potentially catastrophic. Mr Biden has let the Fed get on with fighting inflation, and wants to raise taxes to reduce deficits. Yet he is also an economic nationalist. His State of the Union address on March 7th was littered with protectionist promises that the government would “Buy American”, and statist ideas about controlling the price of everything from housing to Snickers bars.

事实是，随着企业和工人创新和适应快速变化的世界，美国得以蓬勃发展。如果下一位总统不认识到这一点，美国被吹捧的经济最终将会破灭。 ■

Both Mr Biden and Mr Trump harbour a misplaced nostalgia for the 1950s and ’60s, and justify their policies by painting today’s economy as weaker than it is. Mr Trump thinks trade and immigration have made the country poorer; Mr Biden is deeply distrustful of big business. And where they do acknowledge America’s strengths, both men attribute it to their own misguided interventionism. In fact, they are chipping away at the free markets which are the ultimate source of the country’s wealth.

The truth is America has thrived as its companies and workers have innovated and adapted to a rapidly changing world. If the next president does not recognise that, America’s pumped-up economy will eventually deflate. ■

抖音应该切断与中国的联系 (Time for TikTok to cut its ties to China)
====================================================

为了在西方屏幕上保留，这款视频软件需要新的所有者 (To stay on Western screens, the video app needs new owners)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![抖音应用的图标，用一个美元符号绑起来并标记。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_LDD004.jpg)

***编辑注（2024年3月13日）：**此文已经更新。*

***Editor’s note (March 13th 2024):** This piece has been updated.*

抖音的视频让用户深夜难眠。现在，这款应用与中国的联系也让政客不得安宁。3月13日，美国众议院[通过了一项法案](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/13/will-tiktok-still-exist-in-america)，该法案将迫使抖音的中国所有者字节跳动将该应用出售给其他国籍的所有者，否则将面临在美国被禁的命运。如果参议院照此行事，按一种计量标准，全球最受欢迎的应用可能将从屏幕上消失。

TikTok’s videos keep its users up late into the evening. Now the app’s links to China are causing politicians to lose sleep, too. On March 13th America’s House of Representatives [passed a bill](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/13/will-tiktok-still-exist-in-america) that would force TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the app to an owner of another nationality, or else face a ban in America. If the Senate follows suit, the world’s most downloaded app, by one measure, may start disappearing from screens.

一些[关于抖音的担忧](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/03/30/both-americas-political-camps-agree-that-tiktok-is-troubling)被夸大了。确实，抖音收集用户数据。但没有证据表明它收集的比声称的多（或者比如Facebook等竞争对手多）。如果中国间谍想获取美国人的信息，美国宽松的数据保护法让他们能够从第三方购买这些信息。禁止收集个人数据的中国应用将意味着禁止更多应用，剥夺西方消费者使用全球一些最具活力的数字服务的权利。

Some [fears about TikTok](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/03/30/both-americas-political-camps-agree-that-tiktok-is-troubling) are overblown. True, it hoovers up users’ data. But there is no evidence that it takes more than it claims (or indeed more than rivals such as Facebook). If Chinese spies want to find out about Americans, the country’s lax data-protection laws allow them to buy such information from third parties. Banning Chinese apps that gather personal data would mean outlawing many more, cutting off Western consumers from some of the world’s most dynamic digital services.

抖音还为社交媒体市场带来了受欢迎的竞争。去年十大最受下载的应用中有六款来自Meta，即Facebook的所有者。抖音凭借击败它们跻身榜首，带来了一波创新。全球消费者是赢家。

TikTok has also injected welcome competition into the social-media market. Six of last year’s ten most-downloaded apps came from Meta, Facebook’s owner. TikTok, which beat them to the top spot, has brought in a wave of innovation. Consumers everywhere are the winners.

然而，美国打击抖音的一个理由是合理的。抖音已经发展成一个拥有单独的媒体平台，在美国拥有1.7亿用户。三分之一的美国30岁以下成年人认为抖音不仅是娱乐来源，还是新闻来源。因此，与中国存在联系的抖音引起真正的关注，中国政府与西方存在深层的意识形态冲突，并认为媒体是宣传的工具。

Yet there is one reason why America’s crackdown is justified. TikTok has evolved into a broad media platform with 170m users in America alone. A third of American adults under 30 consider TikTok a source not just of entertainment but of news. It is therefore a real concern that it has links to China, whose government is in deep ideological conflict with the West and sees the media as a tool of propaganda.

大多数国家对传统媒体的外国所有权都设置一些限制（可以问问成为美国公民后接管福克斯新闻的鲁珀特·默多克）。阿布扎比执政家族收购《电讯报》引发英国宣布本周禁止外国政府拥有英国出版物。然而，抖音正迅速变得更具影响力。

Most countries place some restrictions on foreign ownership of old media (ask Rupert Murdoch, who became an American citizen before taking over Fox). A bid by Abu Dhabi’s ruling family for the *Telegraph* newspaper prompted Britain to announce this week that it will ban foreign governments from owning British publications. Yet TikTok is fast becoming more influential.

政府应当对新媒体和传统媒体应用相同的逻辑。 如果说，新平台需要更加警惕。报纸的编辑路线可以明确地看见; 相比之下，每个抖音用户都会得到不同的信息流，而该公司没有提供足够的工具来审查其综合产出。即使有研究显示偏见——有人声称抖音在加沙报道中存在偏见，但无法确定抖音的算法是在响应用户偏好，还是受到北京的操纵。

It is time for governments to apply the same logic to new media as they do to old. If anything, the new platforms require greater vigilance. A newspaper’s editorial line can be seen in black and white; by contrast, every TikTok user gets a different feed, and the company does not provide adequate tools to examine its output in aggregate. Even if studies suggest bias—some allege a skew in TikTok’s Gaza coverage, for instance—it is impossible to know whether TikTok’s algorithm is responding to users’ preferences, or to manipulation from Beijing.

抖音承认曾屏蔽有关天安门广场等主题的视频，但坚称已进行改变。它为将美国用户的数据与其他用户的数据分离做出了昂贵的努力，并开放了其代码供检查。但它也自己削弱了自己。它辩称出售其美国业务将是不切实际的，因为它与企业其他部分联系紧密，从而对其与北京的严格分离要求产生怀疑。它呼吁用户支持，上周一些用户被要求联系国会。这进一步强调了其潜在的政治影响力; 据报道，一些犹豫不决的众议员在他们的电话交换机不堪重负后对抖音产生反感。

TikTok admits it once blocked videos on subjects like Tiananmen Square, but insists it has changed. It has made expensive efforts to separate American users’ data from others’ and opened its code for inspection. But it has undermined itself, too. It argues that selling its American operations would be impractical, since they are so closely linked to the rest of the business—thus casting doubt on its claims of strict separation from Beijing. It has rallied users to its cause, pinging some last week to contact Congress. That only emphasised its potential political clout; some wavering representatives reportedly flipped against TikTok after their switchboards blew up.

最理想的结果是抖音存活下来。它带来竞争和创新，还有[乐趣](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/10/07/tiktoks-rapid-growth-shows-the-potency-of-video)。国会之前的法案允许字节跳动出售，而不仅仅是关闭。如果他们不愿这样做，或者如果中国不允许，字节跳动可以将抖音上市。美国人和其他人从自由选择中受益。但是现在应当将相同的标准应用于新媒体和传统媒体。这需要将一个如此大且有影响力的平台与一个如此狡猾和意识形态化的国家分离。■

The best outcome is one in which TikTok survives. It provides competition and innovation, as well as [fun](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/10/07/tiktoks-rapid-growth-shows-the-potency-of-video). The bill before Congress allows ByteDance to sell up, rather than simply shut down. If it is unwilling to do so—or if China does not let it—ByteDance could float TikTok as a public company. Americans and others benefit from freedom of choice. But it is time the same standards were applied to new media as old. That requires separating a platform as large and influential as TikTok from the sway of a country as manipulative and ideological as China. ■

理解年轻男女之间的鸿沟 (Making sense of the gulf between young men and women)
===============================================================

事情比较复杂。但为男孩提供更好的教育可能有所帮助。 (It’s complicated. But better schooling for boys might help)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![一名年轻男子和女子背对背站立在地面深裂的两侧](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_LDD003.jpg)

**男性**和**女性**有着不同的经历，因此你会预期他们有不同的世界观。尽管如此，在发达国家年轻**男性**和**女性**之间日益拉大的鸿沟令人印象深刻。来自20个这样的国家的民意调查数据显示，在20年前，自认为自己更**自由主义**而非**保守主义**的年龄在18至29岁的**男性**和**女性**之间几乎没有什么差别，但如今这一差距已经扩大到25个百分点。年轻**男性**也似乎比年长的**男性**更反对**女权主义**，打破了每一代比前一代更**自由主义**的趋势。来自27个欧洲国家的民意调查发现，30岁以下的**男性**比65岁以上的**男性**更有可能同意“促进**女性**和女孩的权利已经走得太远，因为这威胁到了**男性**和男孩的机会”。类似的结果在英国、**韩国**和中国也得到确认。而年轻**女性**更可能持相反观点。

Men and women have different experiences, so you would expect them to have different worldviews. Nonetheless, the growing gulf between young men and women in developed countries is striking. Polling data from 20 such countries shows that, whereas two decades ago there was little difference between the share of men and women aged 18-29 who described themselves as liberal rather than conservative, the gap has grown to 25 percentage points. Young men also seem more anti-feminist than older men, bucking the trend for each generation to be more liberal than its predecessor. Polls from 27 European countries found that men under 30 were more likely than those over 65 to agree that “advancing women’s and girls’ rights has gone too far because it threatens men’s and boys’ opportunities”. Similar results can be found in Britain, [South Korea](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/04/08/south-korean-women-are-fighting-to-be-heard) and China. Young women were likely to believe the opposite.

弄清楚发生了什么并不简单。一个很好的起点是要注意，年轻**女性**在学术上远远领先于他们的**男性**同龄人。在欧盟，46%的年轻**女性**获得学位，而年轻**男性**只有35%，这一差距自2002年以来已经翻了一番。其结果之一是，年轻**女性**比**男性**更有可能在早年成年期度过在校园**自由主义**的过渡期。与此同时，在学校学业表现较差的学生中**男生**人数超过了**女生**。在富裕国家，28%的**男生**未能学会基本的阅读技能。而仅有18%的**女生**属于这一情况。

Unpicking what is going on is [not simple](https://www.economist.com/international/2024/03/13/why-the-growing-gulf-between-young-men-and-women). A good place to start is to note that young women are soaring ahead of their male peers academically. In the European Union fully 46% of them earn degrees, versus 35% of young men, a gap that has doubled since 2002. One consequence is that young women are more likely than men to spend their early adulthood in a cocoon of campus liberalism. Meanwhile, boys outnumber girls at the bottom end of the scholastic scale. Across rich countries, 28% of them fail to learn to read to a basic level. That is true of only 18% of girls.

另一个重大变化是，在发达国家程度不同的地方，消除妇女成功职业生涯障碍取得了巨大进展。接受大学教育的**男性**仍然繁荣，通常作为一个高收入异性恋伴侣中的一半。许多**男性**欢迎这些进步并主张进一步。然而，在工作场所和约会市场中陷入困境的教育程度较低的**男性**更可能怀有怨恨，并将他们相对地位的丧失归咎于**女性**。**女性**年轻者大体上对过去的进步感到高兴，但他们敏锐地意识到现实中仍存在威胁和不公，从**男性**暴力到平衡职业与家庭的困难。简而言之，大多数年轻**女性**以及令人担忧的大批年轻**男性**抱怨社会对他们所属性别存在偏见。

Another big change is that, to varying degrees across the developed world, immense progress has been made in reducing the barriers to women having successful careers. College-educated men are still thriving, too—often as one half of a double-high-income heterosexual couple. Many men welcome these advances and argue for more. However, those among their less-educated brothers who are struggling in the workplace and the dating market are more likely to be resentful, and to blame women for their loss of relative status. And young women, by and large, are glad of past progress but are keenly aware that real threats and unfairness remain, from male violence to the difficulty of juggling careers and children. In short, most young women and worryingly large numbers of young men complain that society is biased against their own sex.

年轻**女性**倾向于投票支持**自由主义左翼**政党。有时被这些政党视为毒性**男性**而被抛弃的愤怒的年轻**男性**正在被右翼和极右翼的政客巧妙地争取。在**韩国**，他们的支持帮助一个公开反**女权主义**的总统赢得了权力。在美国，民意调查数据复杂，但一些民意调查专家认为，年轻**男性**对民主党的看法趋于消极。在欧洲，许多国家提供多种政治选择，年轻**男性**的选票帮助推动了德国的AfD、波兰的联盟和Chega等反动组织的崛起，Chega在3月10日的葡萄牙选举中崭露头角。

Young women tend to vote for parties of the liberal left. Angry young men, sometimes dismissed as toxically masculine by those parties, are being shrewdly wooed by [politicians from the right and the far right](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/02/15/national-conservatives-are-forging-a-global-front-against-liberalism). In South Korea their support helped an overtly anti-feminist president win power. In America polls are muddy but some pollsters think young men are souring on the Democrats. In Europe, where many countries offer a kaleidoscope of political choices, young male votes have helped fuel the rise of reactionary outfits such as the AfD in Germany, Confederation in Poland and Chega, which surged at Portugal’s election on March 10th.

这一切都没有简单的解决方案。但显然，应该采取更多措施帮助在学校表现不佳的**男孩**取得更好的成绩。一些可能奏效而又不伤害她们的女同学的政策包括聘请更多男性教师（在富裕国家的小学里男性教师非常稀缺），并允许**男孩**比**女孩**晚一年上学，以反映他们成熟得更晚的事实。更好的职业培训可能鼓励年轻**男性**考虑传统上他们回避的工作，从护理到行政。更好地教育**男孩**不仅有助于**男孩**自身。增加受过教育且（我们希望）不那么愤怒的**男性**的数量将有益于那些必须与他们共处在同一世界中的**女性**。 ■

There is no easy solution to any of this. But clearly, more should be done to help boys lagging behind at school to do better. Some policies that might work without harming their female classmates include hiring more male teachers (who are exceptionally scarce at primary schools in rich countries), and allowing boys to start school a year later than girls, to reflect the fact that they mature later. Better vocational training could encourage young men to consider jobs they have traditionally shunned, from nursing to administration. Schooling boys better would not only help boys. Increasing the supply of educated and (one hopes) less angry men would be good for the women who must share the same world. ■

石油的终局可能会带来极大的冲击 (Oil’s endgame could be highly disruptive)
=======================================================

未来的石油冲击将主要受到需求驱动 (The oil shocks of the future will be driven by demand, not supply)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![加拿大安大略省萨尼亚圣克莱尔河上的帝国石油炼油厂和化工厂](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_LDP505.jpg)

几十年来，有关石油的最大担忧始终集中在其供应上。这个教训最早是在半个世纪前学到的，当时石油输出国组织的阿拉伯成员国禁止向美国和其他支持以色列的国家出口石油，那是在阿以战争期间。今天，你可能认为能源与地缘政治之间的联系已经被幸运地切断了。即使战争重返中东，俄罗斯对乌克兰的入侵使其成为西方的社会贬义者，[石油市场](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/03/meet-the-shrewdest-operators-in-todays-oil-markets)大体上却保持了平静。然而，事实上，一个新阶段即将开始——在这个阶段中，石油需求而非供应将成为能源市场的主要影响因素。这种转变将带来深远的地缘政治影响。

For decades, the biggest fears about oil centred on its supply. The lesson was first learnt half a century ago, when the Arab members of opec banned exports to America and other supporters of Israel in the Arab-Israeli war. Today you might think that the link between energy and geopolitics has been mercifully severed. Even as war has returned to the Middle East and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made it a pariah to the West, [oil markets](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/03/meet-the-shrewdest-operators-in-todays-oil-markets) have been largely quiescent. In fact, however, a new phase is beginning—one in which oil demand, not supply, will be the primary influence on energy markets. This shift will bring with it profound geopolitical consequences.

各国政府正在制定政策，旨在减少石油需求并增加替代能源，以应对气候变化。像是驱动[电动汽车](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/12/can-lorries-go-green-faster)背后的技术正在变得越来越便宜和先进。正如我们本周的[专题报道](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2024/03/11/for-50-years-the-story-of-oil-has-been-one-of-matching-supply-with-increasing-demand)所指出的那样，全球石油需求的即将达到峰值和随后的下降将决定未来几十年的价格和产量。

Governments everywhere are designing policies to reduce the demand for oil and boost alternative sources of energy, as they seek to fight climate change. Technologies such as those behind [electric vehicles](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/12/can-lorries-go-green-faster) are only becoming cheaper and more advanced. As our [special report](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2024/03/11/for-50-years-the-story-of-oil-has-been-one-of-matching-supply-with-increasing-demand) argues this week, the coming peak and subsequent decline of global demand for oil will determine prices and production over the decades to come.

这种转变将朝着让某些生产者拥有更多市场力量的方向发展。迄今为止，沙特阿拉伯及其波斯湾地区OPEC邻国拥有最大、最低碳排放和成本最低的石油储量。随着石油市场的萎缩，它们的生产份额将激增。根据石油公司Bp的数据，根据能源过渡的速度，到2050年，该集团在全球产量中的市场份额可能达到一半甚至三分之二，而今天这一比例不到40%。例如科威特、沙特阿拉伯和阿联酋等地已经拥有一些全球最大的主权财富基金，正在忙着[投入资金和影响力](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/11/is-saudi-aramco-cooling-on-crude-oil)到其邻近地区及更远地方。它们的资本堆积和希望在国外彰显实力的意愿只会进一步增强。

Perversely, this shift will grant some producers more market power. The biggest, least carbon-intensive and cheapest reserves of petroleum by far are found in Saudi Arabia and its immediate OPEC neighbours in the Persian Gulf. As the market for oil shrinks, their share of production will soar. Depending on the pace of the energy transition, this cabal could command a market share of half or even two-thirds of global output by 2050, according to Bp, an oil firm, compared with less than 40% today. Already places such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are home to some of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds and are busily [deploying capital and influence](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/11/is-saudi-aramco-cooling-on-crude-oil) in their neighbourhood and beyond. Their piles of capital, and their desire to project their strength abroad, will only intensify.

与此同时，其他石油大国将会落后。如今，非洲、拉丁美洲和亚洲数十个国家的国家石油公司正在开采比海湾地区石油成本更高、碳排放更高的石油。根据一项数据，如果各国如官方承诺的那样在2050年实现净零排放，那么未来十年计划投资1.8万亿美元中约有1.2万亿美元可能将无利可图。尼日利亚的Nnpc、墨西哥的Pemex和印度尼西亚的Pertamina等公司最容易陷入困境，陷于困境的资产无法变现。由于许多产油国政府经常过于依赖商品收入，一些国家石油公司的失败可能导致债务危机、破产和十年的发展停滞。这将是上世纪80年代拉丁美洲陷入的债务危机的翻版，当时石油价格上涨导致进口国贸易逆差扩大，令其无法偿还债务。

Meanwhile, other oil powers will be left behind. Today national oil firms in several dozen countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia are pumping oil that is higher-cost and more carbon-intensive than the oil in the Gulf. By one measure, some $1.2trn of the $1.8trn in investments planned for the next decade by national oil companies could turn out to be unprofitable if countries make good on their official pledges to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Nigeria’s Nnpc, Mexico’s Pemex and Indonesia’s Pertamina are among those most at risk of being stuck with stranded assets. Because governments in many producing countries are often unduly reliant on commodity revenues, the failure of some national oil firms could lead to debt crises, bankruptcies and a decade of lost development. This would be a mirror-image of the debt crises that engulfed Latin America in the 1980s, after rising oil prices widened importing countries’ trade deficits and crippled their ability to repay their debts.

如何应对这种混乱？加快能源过渡对于解决气候变化是必要的，但过渡速度越快，市场力量集中度就越高，高成本生产国的冲击就越大。同时，政府战略性石油储备等应对机制可帮助降低石油消费者的波动性。这些机制应扩大到包括亚洲和非洲等即将超过中国成为石油需求增长最大贡献者的大发展中国家。国际能源署，作为第一个石油危机之后成立的官方机构，已经协调了发达国家保留的战略性石油库存。它与印度的新协商应扩大到包括其他大新兴经济体。

How to manage this disruption? Speeding up the energy transition is necessary to tackle climate change, but the faster the transition, the worse the concentration of market power, and the greater the shock to high-cost producers. In the meantime coping mechanisms such as governments’ strategic petroleum reserves could help to reduce volatility for oil consumers. These should be expanded to include the big developing countries in Asia and Africa, which will soon surpass China to become the biggest contributors to oil demand growth. The International Energy Agency, an official body created in the wake of the first oil shock, already co-ordinates strategic stocks kept by advanced economies. Its new negotiations with India should be expanded to include other big emerging economies, too.

与此同时，对于那些不走运的生产国，优先事项必须是在油价相对较高、需求仍然旺盛时进行多元化。一些国家，例如哥伦比亚的Ecopetrol和马来西亚的Petronas，已经将相当大一部分资本预算用于包括可再生能源、氢能和碳捕集在内的低碳技术，这有望抵御石油崩溃的风险。然而，平均而言，国家石油公司将不到5%的资本支出用于多元化；相比之下，西方石油巨头的这一比例为15%。政府也必须努力确保经济能够摆脱对石油的依赖，通过制定商业友好的规则并投资于基础设施和教育等领域，以促使私营企业蓬勃发展。尽管如此，一些国家可能最终仍需要紧急援助，使多边机构承受更大压力。过去半个世纪的以供应为主导的石油冲击曾是地缘政治动荡的一个频繁来源。除非未来的过渡更具远见，否则下一个半个世纪同样不会平静。■

For the unlucky producers, meanwhile, the priority must be to diversify while oil prices are relatively high and demand still strong. A few, ranging from Colombia’s Ecopetrol to Malaysia’s Petronas, are already spending a hefty share of their capital budgets on low-carbon technologies including renewables, hydrogen and carbon capture that could provide a hedge against an oil collapse. On average, however, national oil firms allocate barely 5% of their capital spending towards diversification; the West’s oil majors, by contrast, spend 15%. Governments, too, must seek to ensure that economies can diversify away from oil, by setting business-friendly rules and spending on things like infrastructure and education, to allow private enterprise to thrive. Even so, some countries may nonetheless eventually require bail-outs, putting multilateral institutions under further strain. The supply-led oil shocks of the past half-century were a frequent source of geopolitical tumult. Unless the coming transition is approached with more foresight, the next-half century will be no less fraught. ■

Cases of Australian wine are sitting in the city’s warehouses, much more than Hong Kongers can imbibe (safely). Grudge-holding officials in Beijing are fermenting this trouble—but perhaps not for much longer.

中国的怨愤源于2020年，当时澳大利亚政府呼吁国际对新冠病毒起源进行调查。两国之间的紧张局势已经在升级。对中国而言，这是个临界点。它对澳大利亚产品实施了贸易限制，如大麦和牛肉。之后，澳大利亚葡萄酒面临的关税从116%上调至218%。中国没有将这些措施与外交争端挂钩，但这被普遍视为报复行动。

China’s case of sour grapes dates to 2020, when Australia’s government called for an international probe into the origins of covid-19. Tensions between the countries had already been rising. For China, this was a tipple point. It placed trade restrictions on Australian products such as barley and beef. Later Australian wine was hit with tariffs that now range from 116% to 218%. China did not link the measures to the diplomatic spat, but they were widely seen as retaliation.

直到那时，中国对澳大利亚葡萄酒的需求似乎是不可抑制的。两国在2015年签署自由贸易协定后，业务迅速增长。2019年，中国消费了澳大利亚葡萄酒出口量的40%。一些观察者表示，习惯于白酒的中国人喜欢澳大利亚葡萄的浓烈口味和高酒精含量。其他人则指出了品质。但价格可能是最大的因素。2020年，中国葡萄酒生产商抱怨低价位的澳大利亚葡萄酒对他们造成了伤害。

Until then, China’s thirst for Australian wine had seemed unquenchable. Business took off after the two countries signed a free-trade agreement in 2015. In 2019 China drank up 40% of Australia’s wine exports. Used to *baijiu*, a strong liquor, Chinese boozers like the bold flavours and high alcohol content of Australian wine, say some observers. Others point to the quality. But price may be the biggest factor. In 2020 Chinese winemakers complained that low-price Australian wine was hurting them.

新的关税导致这种贸易“一夜之间消失”，澳大利亚葡萄酒生产者埃迪·麦克杜格尔说道。去年，与2019年相比，销往中国的澳大利亚葡萄酒减少了99%。原本应该运往中国的许多葡萄酒如今积灰尘。

The new tariffs caused the trade to “vanish overnight”, says Eddie McDougall, an Australian wine producer. Sales of Australian wine to China were 99% lower last year compared with 2019. Many of the bottles originally destined for China are gathering dust.

最终，中国看起来将放松对澳大利亚实施的惩罚性贸易战，以努力缓解紧张局势。2022年由安东尼·阿尔巴尼斯领导的新澳大利亚政府的当选让中国在此问题上有了退缩的理由。去年，其他商品的关税已经取消。信号显示，中澳关系有所改善，阿尔巴尼斯先生于去年11月在北京与中国领导人习近平（如图片中所示）会面。

At last China looks set to uncork the flow, as part of an effort to de-escalate its punitive trade war against Australia. The election of a new Australian government, led by Anthony Albanese, in 2022 gave China cover to back down. Tariffs on other goods were lifted last year. In a sign of improved relations, Mr Albanese met Xi Jinping, China’s leader (pictured), in Beijing in November.

据预计，中国有望在本月结束对葡萄酒关税的审查。澳大利亚生产商对此持乐观态度，这也解释了香港葡萄酒过剩的现象。他们正将葡萄酒存储在那里，以便在关税取消时迅速进入中国内地。希望这一事件不会有很长的后续。■

China is expected to wrap up a review of the wine tariffs this month. Australian producers are optimistic, which explains the glut in Hong Kong. They are storing wine there so that it can swiftly enter the mainland if the tariffs go. Hopefully the saga won’t have a long finish.■

中国是气候的圣者还是恶棍？ (Is China a climate saint or villain?)
=================================================

它在推动绿色转型的同时燃烧着成山的煤炭。 (It is supercharging the green transition—while burning mountains of coal)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![中国太阳能电池板旁冒起的烟雾](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_CNP001.jpg)

**李强**的“工作报告”中最常提到的词之一是“**绿色**”。他的前任总理在去年的讲话中提到这个词九次；而李强几乎翻了一番（见图表1）。这并不奇怪。中国是**绿色技术**的强国：其**电池**、太阳能电池板和**电动汽车**（EVs）居于世界领先地位。中国官员希望这类产业推动未来的经济增长，同时实现中国自身对**能源自给自足**的追求。

AMONG THE words mentioned most often by Li Qiang in his “work report”—a sort of state-of-the-nation address—on March 5th was “green”. His predecessor as prime minister used it nine times in last year’s speech; Mr Li nearly doubled that (see chart 1). This is hardly surprising. China is a green-technology powerhouse: its batteries, solar panels and electric vehicles (EVs) lead the world. Chinese officials want such industries to spur future economic growth and China’s own pursuit of energy self-sufficiency.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_CNC769.png)

然而，尽管李强所言的“人类与自然和谐相处”，中国每年排放的温室气体占全球的逾四分之一（见图表2）。过去三十年中，中国排放的二氧化碳总量已超过其他任何国家。这引出一个关键问题：在气候变化问题上，中国是恶棍还是圣人？

Yet for all the talk of “harmony between humanity and nature”, as Mr Li put it, China emits more than a quarter of the world’s greenhouse gases each year (see chart 2). Over the past three decades it has released more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, in total, than any other country. That all adds up to a big question: is China a villain or a saint when it comes to climate change?

指责中国为恶棍的理由很明显。作为全球最大的污染国，中国的排放量去年增长了约5%。约一半的排放来自由燃煤电厂主导的**电力部门**。另约三分之一的排放来自工厂，特别是钢铁铸造厂（去年，中国生产了10亿吨的钢，超过全球总产量的一半）。汽车和卡车也是中国排放的另一个主要贡献者，排放了中国总排放的近十分之一。为了使车辆正常运行，中国消耗的石油仅次于美国。

The case for villainy is straightforward. Already the world’s leading polluter, China’s emissions rose by about 5% last year. About half come from the power sector, which is dominated by coal-fired plants. Another third or so belch out of factories, particularly steel foundries (last year China produced 1bn tonnes of the metal, over half the world’s total). Cars and lorries are the other big contributor, spewing nearly a tenth of China’s emissions. To keep its vehicles running, China consumes more oil than any country bar America.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_CNC780.png)

中国官员辩解说，西方国家在中国开始实现工业化很久之前，负责过去一个世纪大部分排放。如今这些国家将许多制造业（因此也涉及排放）外包给了中国。然而，他们继续辩解说，中国的人均排放量仍仅为美国的三分之二（美国人口不到中国的四分之一）。这些都说得过去，但这都不改变这一事实：为了实现全球气候目标，中国必须大幅减少排放。

Defensive Chinese officials note that Western countries, which started industrialising long before China did, are responsible for the bulk of emissions over the past century. Today these countries outsource much of their manufacturing—and, therefore, emissions—to China. Yet, the defence continues, China’s emissions per person are still only two-thirds of the level in America (which has less than a quarter of China’s population). This is all fair enough, but none of it changes the fact that for the world to meet its climate goals, China will have to drastically reduce its emissions.

中国有减排的雄心。中国已安装的**可再生能源**多于任何其他国家。政府补贴鼓励生产和购买绿色产品，如**EVs**。这些政策与其他重大变化同时发生。经过数十年的修建道路和铁路，以及生产大量碳密集的钢铁和水泥，中国正在步入发展不那么“脏”的阶段。因此，预计中国的排放将在未来几年内达到峰值，肯定会在2030年之前达到峰值，这也是中国在气候谈判中承诺的目标。

It has ambitions to do so. China has installed more renewable power than any other country. Government subsidies encourage the manufacture and purchase of green products, such as EVs. These policies have coincided with other big changes. After decades of building roads and railways—and producing masses of carbon-intensive steel and cement—China is moving into a less dirty phase of development. As a result, China’s emissions are expected to peak in the next few years and certainly by 2030, which is the goal China has committed itself to in climate negotiations.

然而，专家担忧接下来会发生什么。中国的排放可能会达到顶峰，而非下降。其在2060年实现**零净排放**（或成为“碳中和”）的目标似乎岌岌可危。监察员“气候行动追踪者”称中国的政策“高度不够”。大多数国家，包括中国在内，承诺将自工业革命以来全球变暖控制在2°C以下。气候行动追踪者认为，如果所有国家的雄心水平与中国相匹配，将会导致与工业革命前相比多达4°C的升温，这可能是一个潜在灾难性的结果。

But experts are worried about what happens next. There is a risk that China’s emissions plateau, rather than fall. Its goal of eliminating net emissions (or becoming “carbon neutral”) by 2060 seems in doubt. Climate Action Tracker, a watchdog, calls China’s policies “highly insufficient”. Most countries, including China, have pledged to keep global warming since the Industrial Revolution well below 2°C. Climate Action Tracker reckons that China’s level of ambition, if matched by all countries, would lead to as much as 4°C of warming compared with the pre-industrial average, a potentially catastrophic outcome.

在中国，您很可能会看到排放**碳**的工厂或冒烟的烟囱与巨大的风力涡轮机或一排排太阳能电池板相邻。（您的汽车也可能是电动汽车。）这种悖论是中国气候政策的核心。全球最大的二氧化碳排放国也是全球绿色技术的最大来源。中国企业生产了全球90%的**太阳能电池单元**（太阳能电池板的基本组件）、60%的锂离子电池和一半以上的电动汽车。这些产业在中国被称为“新三剑客”。

Drive across China and it is not unusual to see carbon-spewing factories or belching smokestacks in proximity to enormous wind turbines or rows of solar panels. (Your car is likely to be electric, too.) This paradox lies at the heart of China’s climate policy. The world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide is also its top source of green technology. Chinese companies make 90% of the world’s solar cells (the building blocks of solar panels), 60% of its lithium-ion batteries and over half of its electric vehicles. These industries are known as the “new three” in China.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_CNC742.png)

近20年来，共产党一直将新三视为经济增长的推动力。2008年为缓解全球金融危机的刺激计划向**绿色技术**制造商提供了数十亿美元的补贴。此后，他们又获得了数十亿美元的资金，同时受益于中国对许多（如锂等）用于这些产品的原材料的控制。如今，党称气候技术为“新生产力”，这是它偏爱的高附加值产业的流行词。

For nearly two decades the Communist Party has focused on the new three as drivers of economic growth. A stimulus package to cushion the impact of the global financial crisis in 2008 showered billions of dollars in subsidies on green-tech manufacturers. They have since received billions more, while benefiting from China’s control of many of the raw materials (such as lithium) that go into such products. Today the party calls climate tech a “new productive force”, a buzzword for the high-value-added industries that it favours.

中国希望新三能够在放弃依赖低端制造业投资、基础设施支出和房地产市场的旧经济增长模式的同时，保持经济的持续增长。据芬兰智库“能源与清洁空气研究中心”（CREA）称，去年清洁能源产业为中国GDP增长贡献了40%。增长的**绿色技术出口**（见图表3）占据了中国与世界贸易的日益增长的份额。去年，新三占中国总出口的4.5%，比2020年的1.5%增长了三倍。

China hopes the new three will keep its economy humming as it moves away from its old model of growth, which relied on investment in low-end manufacturing, infrastructure spending and the property market. Last year clean-energy industries accounted for 40% of China’s GDP growth, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a think-tank in Finland. Rising green-tech exports (see chart 3) make up an increasing share of China’s trade with the world. Last year the new three accounted for 4.5% of China’s total exports, up from 1.5% in 2020.

在某些情况下，这引起了外国政府的反弹。以**EV**为例，中国通过廉价贷款、股权注资、购车补贴和国家合同推动了这个产业。中国企业还强制性地从与外国汽车制造商的合资企业转移技术。富裕世界的政策制定者因此正在考虑如何保护国内汽车制造商免受这种国家支持的竞争。

In some cases, this has led to a backlash from foreign governments. Take EVs, an industry China has boosted with cheap loans, equity injections, purchase subsidies and state contracts. Chinese firms have also coercively transferred technology from joint ventures with foreign carmakers. Rich-world policymakers are thus considering how to protect their carmakers from this state-backed competition.

但中国企业也展现了勤奋、远见和创新。规模经济帮助它们保持低成本。这导致价格低廉，而这些价格又被激烈的竞争进一步压低。中国有大约150家汽车制造商，其中包括外国品牌。中国生产的**EV**比欧洲制造的便宜约五分之一。类似的动态也在其他**绿色技术**产业中发挥作用。例如，大型太阳能制造商**龙晟绿色能源科技**表示，其太阳能电池板单位产生的能源的平均寿命周期成本在2015年至2021年间下降了60%。

But Chinese firms have also displayed hard work, foresight and innovation. Economies of scale have helped them to keep costs low. That has led to low prices, which have been driven down further by intense competition. There are around 150 carmakers in China, including foreign brands. EVs made in the country cost about a fifth less than those made in Europe. Similar dynamics are at work in other green-tech industries. For example, LONGi Green Energy Technology, a big solar manufacturer, says the average lifetime cost per unit of energy generated by its solar panels fell by 60% between 2015 and 2021.

尽管这种技术大多出口，中国被认为是圣贤的主要原因很大程度上取决于其在国内的**可再生能源**投放。在这方面，事情发展迅速。据新华社报道，中国去年销售的新汽车中四分之一以上是电动或混合动力车。电动汽车的广泛采用使分析师得出结论，中国对汽油的需求可能已经达到顶峰。

While much of this technology is shipped abroad, China’s case for sainthood depends in large part on its renewable-energy roll-out at home. In this area, things are moving quickly. China added 293 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar capacity in 2023, more than doubling its previous record in 2022. (For comparison, Britain’s total power capacity is less than 100GW.) Over a quarter of the new cars sold in China last year were electric or hybrid, according to Xinhua, the state news service. The widespread adoption of EVs has led analysts to conclude that the demand for petrol in the country may have already peaked.

因此，中国似乎正在走向绿色的未来。但存在一个重大问题：煤。中国一半多的能源来自燃烧这种黑色岩石。（从2011年开始70%的比例已经下降了。）但总的来说，随着中国对电力的总需求增加，每年燃烧的煤量仍在增加。去年新增了47GW的新煤电容量，比2022年的28GW增加。官员们每周批准两座新煤电厂。

China, then, might seem to be on its way to a green future. But there is a big problem: coal. Over half of China’s energy comes from burning the black rock. That has fallen from about 70% in 2011. In total, though, more coal is burned every year as China’s overall demand for electricity increases. Last year 47GW of new coal capacity went into operation, up from 28GW in 2022. Officials approved an average of two new coal-fired power plants a week.

考虑到现有煤电厂利用率的下降，一些计划中的电厂可能永远不会投入使用。但对于地方政府来说，建设（有需要或没有需要的）煤电厂是促进经济增长的一种方式。煤炭产业支持着约270万份工作，这使得难以控制。

Given the declining utilisation rates of existing coal plants, some of the planned ones may never be used. But for local governments, building a coal plant (needed or not) is a way to boost economic growth. The coal industry supports about 2.7m jobs. That makes it difficult to tame.

煤对中国领导人也有利。他们的首要任务是确保可靠的电力供应。中国石油和天然气相对较少，依赖进口。但它有大量的煤矿储备。去年中国挖掘了创纪录的47亿吨煤，这一过程释放出**甲烷**，另一种危险的温室气体。中国对所有人为产生的**甲烷**排放负责约10%。

Coal suits Chinese leaders in another way, too. Their first priority is to ensure a reliable power supply. China has relatively little oil and gas, depending on imports of each. But it has vast reserves of coal. Last year China dug up a record 4.7bn tonnes of the stuff, a process that releases methane, another dangerous greenhouse gas. China is responsible for around 10% of all human-caused methane emissions.

**可再生能源**似乎是解决所有这些问题的方案。但它并不能像煤炭发电厂那样给中国领导人带来同样的安全感。首先，绿色能源依赖于自然的合作，而煤炭发电厂可以自由调节上下。最近几年，中国官员受到干旱扰乱水电供应、导致某些地区停电的影响。在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰并将油气价格推高后，中国加大了对煤炭的投入。

Renewable power might seem like a solution to all this. But it doesn’t provide China’s leaders with the same sense of security as coal. For a start, green energy depends on nature’s co-operation, whereas coal-fired power plants can be ramped up and down at will. Officials were spooked in recent years when droughts disrupted hydropower supplies, leading to blackouts in some areas. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, sending oil and gas prices soaring, China doubled down on coal.

然而，根据一些观察家的观点，中国已经达到了一个拐点。据政府间组织国际能源机构（IEA）称，中国从可再生能源中产生的电力增长速度快于该国的电力需求增长。预计水电供应将在处于两年低点后出现反弹。风力和太阳能容量的增长正在加速。中国正在快速建造核电站。这些变化为IEA所言“奠定了从2024年开始煤炭消费下降的基础”。

According to some observers, though, China has reached an inflection point. Energy generation from renewable sources is growing faster than electricity demand in the country, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), an intergovernmental organisation. A rebound in hydropower availability is expected after a two-year low. The growth in wind and solar capacity is accelerating. And China is building nuclear power stations faster than any other country. These changes are “laying the foundation for coal consumption to decline from 2024 onwards”, says the IEA.

希望中国在国内更快地推广清洁能源。有两个乐观因素，首先是技术。中国已成为全球**绿色技术**的实验室。据研究机构**彭博新能源财经**称，去年全球在这一领域的投资达6760亿美元，其中中国占38%，是美国投资额的两倍多。中国在核技术方面也走在前列。去年12月，中国开始运营世界上第一座“第四代”核反应堆，设计用于比以往模型更高效地利用燃料。中国正开发多种实验反应堆，其目标是2035年使其电力的10%来自核能。

The hope is that China moves even more quickly to roll out clean energy at home. There are two grounds for optimism, starting with technology. China has become the laboratory for the world on green tech. Last year $676bn was invested in the field in China, accounting for 38% of the world’s total and more than double the amount that was invested in America, according to BloombergNEF, a research firm. It is also ahead on nuclear technology. In December it began operating the world’s first “fourth generation” nuclear reactor, designed to use fuel more efficiently than previous models. Several other experimental reactors are also being developed in China, which aims to produce 10% of its electricity from nuclear power by 2035.

另一个值得关注的领域是**氢**，这是一个巨大的潜在清洁燃料来源。通常使用的一种巨大设备叫做电解器，用于从水中将氢与氧分离。问题就在于：这个过程消耗大量能源且昂贵。但随着电解器变得更加高效以及低碳能源成本的降低，所谓的“**绿色**”氢或许会变得经济实惠。国际能源署表示，利用可再生电力生产氢气的成本在这个十年内可能会下降30%。中国已经在这个行业中发挥着重要作用，全球大约40%的电解器是由中国制造的。一些省份已经启动了旨在生产**绿色**氢气的试点项目，而国有企业也承诺到2050年建设一条长达6000公里的管道网络用来运输氢气。

Another area to watch is hydrogen, a vast potential source of clean fuel. A giant machine called an electrolyser is often used to strip hydrogen from oxygen in water. Therein lies the rub: that process eats up energy and is expensive. But as electrolysers become more efficient and the cost of low-carbon energy declines, so-called “green” hydrogen might become economical. The IEA says the cost of producing hydrogen from renewable electricity could fall by 30% over the course of this decade. China is already playing a big role in the industry. It makes about 40% of the world’s electrolysers. Several provinces have launched pilot projects aimed at producing green hydrogen and state-owned firms have pledged to build a 6,000km pipeline network to transport it by 2050.

在其他领域出现意想不到的突破（可以称之为奇迹），比如核聚变，可能会让中国配得上圣人的称号。但更平凡的发展也可能对国内产生重大影响。例如，使电网更加灵活将使中国能够更好地利用已经存在的可再生能源。目前，一个地方的电力过剩往往会被浪费掉。但官员们正在取得进展。他们建立了一条电力输电线网，帮助将西部地区的大量风能和太阳能资源转移到东部的工业中心。尽管中国的电网储能总量比美国少，但中国的储能增长速度更快。

Unexpected breakthroughs (call them miracles) in other areas, such as nuclear fusion, might qualify China for sainthood. But more mundane developments could also have a big impact at home. For example, making the power grid more flexible would allow China to better utilise the renewable energy it already has in place. At the moment, a surplus in one spot often goes to waste. But officials are making progress. They have built a network of power lines to help move renewable power from western China, where there are lots of wind and solar resources, to industrial centres in the east. And although China has less total energy storage in its grid than America, it is adding storage faster.

希望中国向可再生能源转变的速度超出预期的另一个原因是在于其更好政策的空间。在这方面，电网也提供了一个例子。各省份政府对其管辖范围内的电网有很大控制权。他们不喜欢依赖其他省份的能源。因此，一些省份更倾向于使用自己的燃煤电厂，而不是位于其他地方的更清洁的能源。改革可能会让可再生能源更快地纳入电网中。

The other reason to hope that China’s shift to renewables happens faster than expected is its scope for better policies. Here, too, the grid provides an example. Provincial governments have much control over their portions of it. They don’t like relying on each other for energy. So some provinces prefer to use their own coal plants rather than cleaner sources located elsewhere. Reforms might allow renewable energy to be added to the grid faster.

加强排放限制也会有所帮助。目前，中国的碳市场覆盖了约40%的国家排放量。违规的罚款微不足道。但据彭博社报道，这一切可能会在今年有所改变，援引未公开的政府计划。预计到2030年，将有七个行业纳入该市场。这些行业包括铝业、水泥和钢铁生产等排放碳量较大的行业。政府还计划在今年提高处罚力度。由于来自国外的压力不断增加，这样的努力变得日益必要。从2026年起，欧盟将开始根据生产过程中排放的碳量对进口商品征税。

Tighter rules on emissions would also help. At the moment China’s carbon market covers around 40% of the country’s emissions. Fines for breaking the rules are paltry. But that may all change this year, reports Bloomberg, citing an unpublished government plan. Seven industries are expected to be added to the market by 2030. These include big carbon-emitting sectors such as aluminium, cement and steel production. The government is also planning to increase penalties this year. Such efforts are increasingly necessary owing to pressure from abroad. From 2026 the EU will start taxing imports based on how much carbon was emitted while making them.

中国官员是否会面临国内压力是另一个问题。中国很少有人表达对气候变化的担忧。大多数人认为政府在可再生能源方面做得很好（自2012年以来，政府一直在打击环保非政府组织和活动人士）。但观点可能会迅速转变。十年前，公众对空气污染的抱怨声浪高涨，迫使政府采取行动。政府迅速实施了反污染措施，尽管没有出台能更好应对气候问题的广泛改革。如果气候变化的影响变得更加明显，这些改革可能会出台。中国沿海地区易受海平面上升而引起的洪水威胁，北方干旱地区缺乏饮用水。去年，干旱使全国各地的庄稼受损。

Whether Chinese officials will face pressure at home is another question. Few people in China express much concern about climate change. Most think the government is doing a good job when it comes to renewable energy. (Since 2012 it has cracked down on environmental NGOs and activists.) But opinions can shift quickly. A decade ago public complaints about air pollution grew so loud that the state was forced to act. It quickly imposed anti-pollution measures, though not the type of broad reforms that would lead to greater progress on the climate. Those may come if the effects of climate change become more tangible. China’s coastline is vulnerable to flooding as sea levels rise. The arid north lacks drinking water. Last year droughts damaged crops across the country.

然而，迄今为止，政府仍在努力改变。以2021年自我设定的六个目标为例，这些目标将在2025年前实现。其中一个是“严格控制”煤炭消耗增长。另一个是将碳强度（单位经济产出所产生的排放量的衡量标准）削减18%。据CREA的Lauri Myllyvirta表示，中国在所有这些目标上都“严重偏离轨道”。

So far, though, the government is struggling to change. Take the six targets China set for itself in 2021, to be met by 2025. One was “strictly controlling” growth in coal consumption. Another was cutting carbon intensity—a measure of emissions generated per unit of economic output—by 18%. China is “severely off track” for all of these goals, says Lauri Myllyvirta of the CREA.

尽管如此，中国官员们继续大谈创建绿色经济、实现碳中和的宏伟计划。“我们将推动能源革命，加强对化石燃料消耗的控制，并加速发展新能源系统，”李先生在国情咨文中表示。但他补充说：“我们会确保煤炭和燃煤电力在保障能源供应中发挥关键作用。”在这种情况下，中国在应对气候问题上获得圣人称号的论点将变得微弱。■

Nevertheless, Chinese officials continue to talk a big game about creating a green economy and achieving carbon neutrality. “We will advance the energy revolution, tighten control over fossil-fuel consumption and work faster to develop a new energy system,” said Mr Li in his state-of-the-nation speech. But he added: “We will see that coal and coal-fired power play their crucial role in ensuring energy supply.” Until that changes, China’s case for climate sainthood will be weak. ■

新数据显示美国高中标准下降 (New numbers show falling standards in American high schools)
========================================================================

表现较差的学生可能受到最严重影响 (Low-achieving pupils may suffer the most)
--------------------------------------------------------

![卡耐基先锋高中的学生毕业了。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_USP001.jpg)

春田，位于马萨诸塞州，可能看起来不太可能成为一个教育奇迹的背景。这座沿康涅狄格河而立的城市拥有15.5万人口，其家庭收入中位数是州平均水平的一半；暴力犯罪很普遍。然而，这座城市的高中毕业率正在飞速上升。在2007年到2022年间，在春田科技高中（Springfield High School of Science and Technology）获得四年制文凭的学生比例从50%上升至94%；在附近的罗杰·普特纳姆职业技术学院（Roger Putnam Vocational Technical Academy），这一比例几乎翻了一番，达到了96%。

SPRINGFIELD, in MASSACHUSETTS, might seem an improbable setting for an education miracle. The city with a population of 155,000 along the Connecticut river has a median household income half the state average; violent crime is common. Yet graduation rates at the city’s high schools are surging. Between 2007 and 2022 the share of pupils at the Springfield High School of Science and Technology who earned a diploma in four years jumped from 50% to 94%; at neighbouring Roger Putnam Vocational Technical Academy it nearly doubled to 96%.

然而，这样的收获并未体现在其他学术指标上。在春田高中，大学入学考试SAT的分数在同一时期下降了15%。英语和数学能力的测评指标也有所下降。高级课程考试的通过率仅为12%，相比之下，全国平均通过率为60%。

Alas, such gains are not showing up in other academic indicators. At Springfield High scores on the SAT, a college-admissions test, have tumbled by 15% over the same period. Measures of English and maths proficiency are down, too. The pass rate on advanced-placement exams has fallen to just 12% compared with a national average of 60%.

春田高中的这一趋势并不罕见。在2007年至2020年间，美国公立高中的[平均毕业率](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/05/the-rise-in-american-high-school-graduation-rates-looks-puffed-up)从74%跃升至87%。在此期间，学生们在课程学分和平均成绩上取得了进步。然而，SAT分数下降了（见图表1）。最新的国际学生评估项目（PISA）结果显示，15岁学生的数学和阅读能力基本持平或有下降。《经济学人》的分析表明，学校为了让更多学生毕业而降低了学术标准。而这一趋势最为伤害表现较差的学生。

The trend at Springfield High is all too common. Between 2007 and 2020 the [average graduation rate](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/05/the-rise-in-american-high-school-graduation-rates-looks-puffed-up) at public high schools in America leapt from 74% to 87%. During this period pupils notched up gains in course credits and grade-point averages. Yet SAT scores fell (see chart 1). Results from the latest Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), an international test of 15-year-olds, show that maths and reading literacy are flat or down. An analysis by *The Economist* suggests that schools are lowering academic standards in order to enable more pupils to graduate. And the trend is hurting low-performing pupils the most.

几十年来，美国一直为其公立学校的学术标准而忧心忡忡。1983年，教育部发布了一份具有里程碑意义的报告《处于危险之中的国家》，警告称美国学校正出现“日益增多的平庸之势”。此举迅速引发回应。在五年内，45个州提高了毕业要求；有超过二十多个州推出了其他改革举措，包括更全面的课程设置和给教师更高的工资。一些州还开始要求毕业生通过“最低能力”考试，这是于上世纪70年代引入的标准化测试，评估学生在八至九年级英语和数学水平上的能力。

America has fretted about academic standards at its public schools for decades. In 1983 the Department of Education released a landmark report, “A Nation At Risk”, which warned of a “rising tide of mediocrity” in the country’s schools. The response was swift. Within five years 45 states had raised graduation requirements; and more than two dozen had introduced other reforms, including more comprehensive curriculums and higher salaries for teachers. Some states also started requiring graduates to pass “minimum-competency” exams, standardised tests introduced in the 1970s that evaluated pupils’ ability to do eighth- or ninth-grade level English and maths.

然而，随着毕业要求的加强，课程内容却变得更加水 down。1996年一项由政策研究机构Public Agenda进行的调查发现，仅有一半的公立高中学生认为他们在学术上受到了挑战。2001年的另一项调查发现，只有四分之一的学生认为他们的老师对他们寄予了很高的期望。即使联邦政府也再次承认学术标准存在不足。教育部的一份报告发现，2005年毕业班学生所学的数学课程中，超过十分之一的内容是小学和初中水平的知识。只有三分之一的代数1学生和五分之一的几何学生接受了“严格”的教学。

But as graduation requirements were toughened up, coursework was watered down. A survey conducted in 1996 by Public Agenda, a policy research group, found that just half of public high-school students felt that they were being challenged academically. Another survey in 2001 found that only a quarter of pupils thought that their teachers had high expectations of them. Even the federal government acknowledged again that academic standards were falling short. A report by the Department of Education found that more than a tenth of maths coursework taken by the class of 2005 consisted of primary- and middle-school-level material. Only a third of algebra 1 students and a fifth of geometry students received “rigorous” instruction.

评分标准也变得更加宽松。最好的证据来自对比课堂成绩与学年末州考成绩之间的表现。美国大学的Seth Gershenson进行的一项研究发现，在2005年至2016年间，北卡罗来纳州公立学校中，在代数1课程中获得B的学生中，有36%在期末考试中不及格。获得C的学生有71%的不及格率。另一项由乔治亚学院和州立大学的Chris Clark进行的研究分析了2007年乔治亚州公立高中的数学课程，得出了类似的结果。Clark先生总结说：“一些学校和学校系统似乎在提高课程成绩，而另一些则似乎要求学生达到更高的标准。”

Grading got easier, too. The best evidence for this comes from comparisons of classroom grades with performance on state exams taken at the end of the school year. A study by Seth Gershenson of American University found that between 2005 and 2016, 36% of North Carolina public-school students who received Bs in their algebra 1 courses failed their end-of-course exams. Pupils with Cs failed 71% of the time. Another study, by Chris Clark of Georgia College & State University, analysed maths courses at Georgia public high schools in 2007 and yielded similar results. “Some schools and school systems appear to be inflating course grades,” Mr Clark concluded, “while others appear to hold their students to higher standards.”

这些证据表明，美国高中的学术标准过低。但这种情况有变得更糟吗？为了回答这个问题，《经济学人》收集了从2007年到2022年，涵盖科罗拉多、乔治亚、伊利诺伊、马萨诸塞、密歇根和北卡罗来纳六个州的3,000所高中的毕业率和标准化考试成绩的数据。

Such evidence suggests that academic standards at American high schools are too low. But are they getting worse? To answer this, *The Economist* assembled data on graduation rates and standardised test scores at 3,000 high schools across six states—Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and North Carolina—for school years from 2007 to 2022.

我们发现，在这一时期，我们样本中的四年制毕业率有所增加，而测试成绩下降。在测试成绩最低的高中，获得的成绩增幅最大。2007年，在我们的样本中，SAT或ACT的成绩位于倒数第十位的学校只有一半的学生毕业；到了2022年，这个比例增加到了三分之二。随着表现较差的学校通过了更多学生，测试成绩和毕业率之间的关系变得更加扑朔迷离（见图表2）。

We found that four-year graduation rates in our sample increased during this period, even as test scores fell. Gains were greatest in high schools with the lowest test scores. In 2007 schools with scores on the sat or act, another college-admissions exam, in the bottom tenth of our sample graduated half of their pupils; in 2022 they graduated two-thirds. As low-performing schools have passed more pupils, the relationship between test scores and graduation rates has weakened (see chart 2).

学术门槛究竟降低了多少？为了量化这一情况，我们对2007年到2022年间的毕业率进行了回归分析，控制了ACT或SAT平均成绩、辍学率和学年因素。如果学术标准保持不变，我们将不会预料到毕业率在年年间有潜在的趋势。然而，我们却发现，即便对测试成绩和辍学率的变化进行了控制，毕业率仍在逐年上升。

Just how far has the academic bar been lowered? To quantify this, we conducted a regression analysis of graduation rates between 2007 and 2022 that controlled for average ACT or SAT scores, dropout rates and school year. If academic standards were consistent over time, we would expect no underlying trend in graduation rates from year to year. Instead, we found that graduation rates drifted upward, even after controlling for changes in test scores and dropout rates.

我们的分析表明，许多学生在不久之前可能无法达到标准，却取得了毕业资格。一些州降低了门槛的程度要远高于其他州。在伊利诺伊州，毕业率比我们根据学术表现单独预期的要高约一个百分点；而在北卡罗来纳州，毕业率几乎高出八个百分点。总体而言，我们发现与15年前相比，我们样本中的公立高中毕业率比实际情况夸大了大约四个百分点。

Our analysis suggests that high schools are graduating thousands of students who, not long ago, might not have made the grade. Some states have lowered the bar more than others. In Illinois graduation rates are about one percentage point higher than we would expect based on academic performance alone; in North Carolina they are nearly eight points higher. Overall, we found that public high schools in our sample are inflating graduation rates by roughly four percentage points compared with 15 years earlier.

怀疑者会指出，今天参加考试的学生群体与15年前相比有很大不同，而这可能使得考试成绩看起来比实际情况更糟。斯坦福大学的Thomas Dee表示：“如果越来越多的学生参加这些考试，那么随着时间的推移，考试人群会以可能在某种程度上使得成绩出现偏低。”然而，这种“组合效应”似乎并不能解释我们的研究结果。我们样本中参加ACT或SAT考试的学生比例实际上从2007年的78%下降到了2022年的68%。这表明，如果有任何不足，我们对毕业率通胀的估计可能过低，而非过高。

Sceptics will point out that the test-taking population is significantly different today than it was 15 years ago, and that this may be making test scores look worse than they actually are. “If more and more students are sitting for these tests,” says Thomas Dee of Stanford University, “the composition changes over time in ways that probably bias scores downward.” Such “compositional effects” do not appear to explain our results, however. The share of students taking the ACT or SAT in our sample actually fell from 78% in 2007 to 68% in 2022. This would suggest that, if anything, our estimates of graduation-rate inflation may be too low, rather than too high.

人们可能会期望决策者们竭力加强学术标准。事实上，他们所做的恰恰相反。去年五月，新泽西州教育委员会投票降低了该州高中毕业考试的及格分数，称当前标准对学生造成了“负面影响”。去年十一月，俄勒冈州教育官员取消了其数学、阅读和写作的“基本技能”毕业考试。至少还有四个州——佛罗里达、马萨诸塞、新泽西和纽约——正在考虑废除自己的毕业考试。今年一月，阿拉斯加州教育委员会投票降低了该州阅读和数学考试的精通标准。

You might expect policymakers to be scrambling to shore up academic standards. In fact, they are doing the opposite. In May last year New Jersey’s board of education voted to lower the passing score on the state’s high-school graduation test, saying the current standards had “adverse impacts” on students. In November Oregon education officials scrapped its “essential skills” graduation exams in maths, reading and writing. At least four more states—Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York—are considering doing away with their own exit exams. In January Alaska’s board of education voted to lower proficiency standards for the state’s reading and maths exams.

学术标准日益降低的趋势在一定程度上可以归咎于2002年通过的《不让一个孩子掉队》（No Child Left Behind）教育改革法。该法案要求各州跟踪四年毕业生的比例，并设定每年的改进目标。未能达到目标的学校将面临制裁，包括可能被关闭。尽管这些政策出发点良好，但却导致了反常结果。为了保持毕业率，老师们设计了提高成绩的创造性方法：允许学生重新参加考试、取消迟交作业的惩罚、调整评分标准。弗吉尼亚州费尔法克斯县的社会学教师Eric Welch说：“我们正在做我称之为‘评分体操’的事情。”来自田纳西州孟菲斯市的数据顾问兼前教师Peter VanWylen解释说：“有很大压力要达到指标，无论如何。”还有更多顾虑也在发挥作用。南加州大学的Morgan Polikoff表示：“教育平等的推动，尤其是种族平等，已经在很多地方被用来反对高中毕业的更高标准。”去年新泽西州就新测试基准展开讨论时，一位教育局成员辩称，提高标准对城市地区的黑人和拉丁裔学生是“不公平”的。俄勒冈州去年在部分取消毕业考试的决定，部分基于教育部门的报告，该报告认为该考试为“历史上边缘化的”群体造成了“不公平的结果”。

The trend towards weakening standards can be blamed in part on No Child Left Behind, an education-reform law passed in 2002. It required states to track the share of students graduating in four years and set annual targets for improvement. Schools that failed to hit their targets faced sanctions, including possible closure. Although such policies were well-intentioned, they had perverse outcomes. To keep graduation rates up, teachers devised creative ways of raising grades: allowing students to retake exams, removing penalties for late assignments, adjusting grading scales. “We’re doing what I call ‘grading gymnastics’,” says Eric Welch, a social-studies teacher in Fairfax County, Virginia. “There’s a lot of pressure to hit the metric, regardless of how you do it,” explains Peter VanWylen, a data consultant and former teacher in Memphis, Tennessee. “Nobody wants to lose their job and so there’s this pressure to get the number where it needs to be.”

降低标准据说可以帮助缩小这种成绩差距。然而，它可能产生相反的效果。宾夕法尼亚大学和圣安东尼奥德克萨斯大学的Brooks Bowden、Viviana Rodriguez和Zach Weingarten最近的一篇工作论文分析了2014年由北卡罗来纳州公立高中引入的更宽松的评分政策对努力和学术表现的影响。作者发现，在学校实施新的评分标准后，导致学生成绩更多为A，更少为F，成绩较差的学生出席率更低，付出的努力更少。高分学生的出勤率没有变化。尽管这一政策导致了稍微提高的毕业率，但也导致了高成绩和低成绩学生之间的GPA和标准化考试成绩差距进一步扩大。

Other concerns are also at work. “The push for educational equity, and in particular racial equity, has been used in a lot of places to push against higher standards for high-school graduation,” says Morgan Polikoff of the University of Southern California. When New Jersey debated new testing benchmarks last year, one board-of-education member argued that a higher standard would be “unfair” to black and Latino students in urban districts. Oregon’s decision to drop its graduation exam in November was based in part on a report by the education department which concluded that the test produced “inequitable outcomes” for “historically marginalised” groups.

这表明，降低门槛的政策可能会损害那些本应受益的学生。“我认为通过更高的成绩或颁发毕业证书来帮助任何人都没有什么好处，”研究报告的作者之一鲍登博士表示。波利科夫博士认为，最好是设定较高的期望。“人会达到你设定的期望。”■

Lowering standards, it is thought, can help narrow such achievement gaps. Yet it may have the opposite effect. A recent working paper by Brooks Bowden, Viviana Rodriguez and Zach Weingarten of the Universities of Pennsylvania and Texas at San Antonio analyses how a more lenient grading policy introduced by North Carolina public high schools in 2014 affected effort and academic performance. The authors found that after schools implemented the new grading scale, which led to more As and fewer Fs, students with low test scores showed up to class less often and put in less effort. The attendance of high-scoring students did not change. Although the policy led to slightly higher graduation rates, it also contributed to wider gaps in GPAs and standardised test scores between high- and low-achieving students.

This suggests that policies that lower the bar may harm the very students they are meant to help. “I don’t think we’re helping anybody by handing out higher grades or giving out graduation certificates,” says Dr Bowden, one of the authors of the study. Better instead to set expectations high, reckons Dr Polikoff. “People rise to the expectations you set.” ■

在纽约地铁部署士兵是否真的像看起来那样疯狂? (Is deploying soldiers on New York’s subway as mad as it seems?)
====================================================================================

凯西·霍克尔州长的举措可能与劳资纠纷有关，也与打击犯罪有关。 (Governor Kathy Hochul’s move may have as much to do with a labour dispute as with crime fighting)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![国民警卫队和额外警员部署到纽约地铁](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_USP005.jpg)

纽约人在地铁中见怪不怪。他们欣赏着一只老鼠拿着一片比萨饼下楼梯的场景。当有人在地铁站台上陷入精神健康危机时，他们感到无能为力。看到“Showtime”舞者翻跟头、悬挂在车厢扶手和杆子上，他们会感到振奋或许有些烦恼。然而，武装士兵近地铁闸门附近的最近出现令人不安。

NEW YORKERS have seen it all in the subway. They watch in appreciation as a rat carries a slice of pizza down a staircase. They feel powerless when someone in the throes of a mental-health crisis shouts and staggers on a subway platform. They are uplifted or perhaps annoyed when “Showtime” dancers backflip and hang from car handles and poles. Yet the recent arrival of armed soldiers near subway turnstiles has been unnerving.

上周，纽约民主党州长凯西·霍库尔部署了750名国民警卫队成员和250名州警协助纽约市警察（NYPD）在部分地铁站进行行李搜查。这是一项旨在改善地铁安全的计划的一部分，还包括增加更多摄像头，实施一个试点方案来治疗严重患有精神疾病的人。

Last week Kathy Hochul, New York’s Democratic governor, deployed 750 members of the National Guard as well as 250 state police to assist New York City’s police (NYPD) in searching bags at some subway stations. It is part of a plan aimed at improving subway safety, along with adding more cameras and implementing a pilot scheme to treat those suffering severely from mental illness.

今年迄今为止，这座城市的暴力犯罪有所下降，但地铁犯罪情况却大不相同：一月份，与去年同期相比上升了47%。其中大部分是由于盗窃增加所致。系统每天有400万乘客出行，绝大多数人平平安安。然而，危机中的个体数量庞大，再加上一些备受关注的袭击事件，引发了警情。最近有列车员的脖子被划伤。一名女性在一名男子将其推到轨道上后失去了双脚。一名十几岁的少年在布朗克斯车站枪杀了一名男子。市长埃里克·亚当斯动用了1000名警察前往地铁，耗费巨大，但取得了一定成功。

Violent crime in the city has declined so far this year, but crime on the subway is a different story: it rose by 47% in January, year over year. Most of that was down to more thefts. The vast majority of the system’s 4m daily riders travel without incident. However, the abundance of individuals in crisis, coupled with some high-profile attacks, has raised alarms. A conductor’s neck was recently slashed. A woman lost her feet after a man pushed her onto the tracks. A teenager fatally shot a man in a Bronx station. Eric Adams, the city’s mayor, deployed 1,000 cops to the subway, at great expense and with some success.

霍库尔女士认为这还不够。纽约市市长和州长之间有着长期的政治攻防历史。在这种情况下，霍库尔女士的动机部分可能受到劳资问题和成本的影响。在列车员遭袭事件后，一些员工举行了类似工作停滞的示威活动，导致了延误。工会要求增加更多的交通警察。州长选择了更经济的士兵，而不是警察。反对声音立即如潮水般而至。“我们的交通系统不是‘战场’！”纽约警察局巡逻主管约翰·切尔在X上写道。其他人则担心有可能侵犯公民权利。

Ms Hochul decided it wasn’t enough. There is a long history of political point-scoring between New York City mayors and state governors. In this case Ms Hochul may have been motivated partly by labour concerns and cost. After the attack on the conductor some employees staged what looked like a work stoppage that caused delays. The union asked for more transit police. The governor chose soldiers, who are cheaper. The backlash was immediate and came from all sides. “Our transit system is not a ‘war’ zone!” John Chell, NYPD’s chief of patrol, wrote on X. Others are worried about civil-rights violations.

当约翰·杰·克雷明斯院长首次听说纽约激活国民警卫队时，他想：“难道发生了什么很糟糕的事情吗？” 国民警卫队是一个州级军事单位。成员是陆军预备役的一部分，可以被部署到海外，就像在阿富汗和伊拉克战争期间经常那样，但如今它们通常是由各州州长在紧急情况下激活的。在新冠疫情期间，他们协助进行检测。在暴风雪期间，他们清理积雪并营救处于危险中的人。“我们高效并注重任务执行，”马里兰州国民警卫队退伍军人、拥有15年经验的克雷明斯先生说。没有比他们更好的人员可以填充沙袋。但这远非紧急情况。国民警卫队并不是一支隐身打击犯罪的武装部队。它甚至没有权利逮捕人。

When Henry Smart of John Jay College of Criminal Justice first heard about the National Guard being activated in New York, he wondered, “did something really bad happen?”. The National Guard is a state-based military unit. Members are part of the army’s reserve and can be deployed overseas, as they were regularly during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but these days they are typically activated by state governors in an emergency. During the covid-19 pandemic they assisted with testing. During blizzards they clear snow and rescue people in danger. “We are efficient and task-orientated,” says Mr Smart, a 15-year veteran of the Maryland National Guard. No better crew can fill a sandbag. But this is far from an emergency. And the National Guard is not a camouflaged crime-fighting force. It is not even permitted to make arrests.

将打击犯罪军事化很少是一个好主意。“将部队部署到地铁表明我们已经输掉了一场我们其实正在赢得的战斗，”倡导团体Riders Alliance的丹尼·珀尔斯坦说。纽约市公民自由联盟负责人唐娜·利伯曼指出，这告诉纽约人我们处于“一种极其糟糕的处境”，而事实上，该市仍然是美国同规模城市中最安全的之一。该市的监察官朱马尼·威廉斯在X上写道，鉴于普遍反对这种部署，“你会认为至少会有一次重新思考”。到目前为止，霍库尔女士仍然坚定不移，尽管她至少停止了士兵携带长步枪的做法。

Militarising crime fighting is seldom a good idea. “Deploying troops to the subway indicates we’ve lost a battle that we actually are winning,” says Danny Pearlstein, of Riders Alliance, an advocacy group. It tells New Yorkers that we are in a “dire state of affairs”, adds Donna Lieberman, head of the New York Civil Liberties Union when, in fact, the city remains one of the safest of its size in America. Jumaane Williams, the city’s ombudsman, wrote on X that given the political consensus against the deployment, “you would think there would be at least a rethinking.”  So far Ms Hochul is holding firm, though she has at least stopped soldiers carrying long-rifles.

与其目瞪口呆不如说，一些其他城市对霍库尔女士派遣部队的决定抱着好奇的态度。芝加哥和费城的交通工会要求国民警卫队部署到他们陷入困境的系统中。费城新市长切雷尔·帕克承诺加强警察巡逻。迄今为止，她和其他当地立法者并不希望国民警卫队参与进来。他们对此持谨慎态度是正确的。武装士兵的戏剧性运用并不能阻止犯罪。■

Rather than looking on aghast, some other cities are regarding Ms Hochul’s decision to send in the troops with curiosity. Transit unions in Chicago and Philadelphia are calling on the National Guard to be deployed on their troubled systems. Cherelle Parker, Philadelphia’s new mayor, has promised to beef up police patrols. So far, she and other local lawmakers do not want the National Guard involved. They are right to be wary. The theatrical use of soldiers does not stop crime.■

犹太教极端正统妇女正在发动性罢工 (Ultra-Orthodox Jewish women are staging a sex-strike)
====================================================================

古希腊曾见效，或许在纽约州也能奏效。 (It worked in ancient Greece; it might work in New York state)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![年轻的犹太妇女举着标语抗议](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_USP004.jpg)

在亚里士多芬的戏剧《女权志》中，一位年轻的雅典女性说服希腊交战国家的妇女们拒绝与其情人发生性关系，以抗议正在进行中的战争。她们一起誓言不在床上「抬起拖鞋到屋顶」，也不「像雌狮一样趴在四肢着地」。很快，男女之间爆发了激烈的冲突，一群愤怒的男人高唱着，称没有比女性更难驯服的野兽了。

In Aristophanes’s play “Lysistrata”, a young Athenian woman persuades the women of warring Greek states to deny their lovers sex in protest at an ongoing war. Together they vow not to raise their “slippers to the roof” or crouch down before a man “like a lioness on all fours”. Soon bitter conflict erupts between the sexes and an angry chorus of men declares that there is no wild beast harder to tame than the woman.

两千多年后，在纽约市外一个小时车程的极端正统犹太安拉同别墅，女性正在进行类似的罢工。据他们的领袖Adina Sash称，有800名妇女上周五晚拒绝与丈夫同床共枕，此时亲密被视为特别神圣。此后更多人加入了这一行动。与希腊人不同，她们并非抗议战争，而是反对一种男性可以把女性束缚在不想要的婚姻中的宗教体系。

More than two millennia later women in Kiryas Joel, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish enclave an hour outside New York City, are carrying out a similar strike. According to their leader, Adina Sash, 800 women refused to sleep with their husbands last Friday night, a time when intimacy is considered especially holy. More have since joined the cause. Unlike the Greeks they are not protesting against war but rather a religious system in which men can shackle women to unwanted marriages.

根据犹太法，离婚直到男方给女方**get**（一封用阿拉米语写成的12行信，声明她不再受他限制）才算正式完成。必须有三位拉比签署才算有效。这导致了一个全球性丑闻，滥用**get**的男人以此获得金钱和子女抚养权，或者不颁发**get**来强迫前伴侣守贞洁、长期单身。

Under Jewish law a divorce is not finalised until a man gives a woman a *get*, a 12-line letter written in Aramaic that declares her no longer bound to him. Three rabbis must sign off on it. That has led to a global scandal where abusive men leverage *get*s for money and custody of children or withhold them to force chastity and singlehood on past partners.

在基里亚士乔尔，一个封闭的地方，女性必须征得拉比的许可才能报告家庭暴力给警察，29岁的Malky Berkowitz已经四年乞求获得**get**。尽管从宗教当局处得到请愿书，她的丈夫Volvy拒绝了。她只是众多受害者之一。Sash女士表示：“Malky就是每位曾像一只温顺、顺从的羊一样与这一制度作斗争的女性的代表。”据称，全球被称为**agunot**的“被束缚”女性人数估计从数百到数千不等。

In Kiryas Joel, an insular place where a woman must ask permission from her rabbi to report domestic violence to the cops, 29-year-old Malky Berkowitz has begged for a *get* for four years. Her husband Volvy has refused despite petitions from religious authorities. She is just one of many. “Malky is the face of every woman who has fought and gone through the system like a docile, demure, obedient sheep,” says Ms Sash. Estimates of the number of “chained” women around the world, known as *agunot*, range from hundreds to thousands.

他们的倡导者已尝试让世俗法院将**get**的拒绝视为虐待。在英国，2021年对法典的修改将该做法视为刑事“胁迫”；一年后，第一个男子因此被监禁18个月。但在美国，变化来得更为缓慢。

Their advocates have tried to get secular courts to recognise *get*-refusal as abuse. In Britain a 2021 amendment to the legal code deemed the practice criminally “coercive”; one year later the first man was jailed for it for 18 months. But in America change is coming more slowly.

执法改革者，警惕着过度执法，对希望加重惩罚并使极端案件成为重罪的受害者维权团体提出异议。与此同时，固执的男性正在利用法律体系来谋取好处：根据一个名为Agunot解决组织的非营利组织，声称要求**get**的女性在法庭上提起滋扰诉讼的数量急剧增加。

Criminal-justice reformers, who police over-policing, have pushed back on victims’-rights groups that want to increase penalties and make egregious cases felonies. Meanwhile recalcitrant men are working the legal system to their advantage: according to the Organisation for the Resolution of Agunot, a non-profit group, there has been a sharp rise in the number filing nuisance lawsuits claiming that women demanding *get*s are harassing or defaming them.

一切困难的不可解之处使美国的妻子们最终采取了极端手段。那些将非法智能手机藏在内衣抽屉中的人——极端正统犹太人中互联网大多被禁止——传递了这一计划。这个想法很简单：通过拒绝性行为让你的伴侣足够在意去催促其他男性采取行动。在一个期望女性为了谦逊而剃发并戴头巾，并在十几岁时与几乎陌生的人结婚的社区中，一些妇女第一次拒绝性行为至今。

The intractability of it all made the American wives finally go for the nuclear option. Those who keep illicit smartphones tucked away in underwear drawers—internet is largely forbidden among the ultra-Orthodox—passed along the plan. The idea was simple: withhold sex to get your man to care enough to press other men to act. In a community where women are expected to shave and cover their heads for modesty and to marry near-strangers as teenagers, some are saying no to sex for the first time since they can remember.

然而，包括Berkowitz女士在内的许多妇女并不太清楚如何看待这次抗议。更高调的声音反对这一举动。赫舍尔·夏克特（Herschel Schacter），一位著名的拉比，在耶史瓦大学管理拉宾学校，宣称这次罢工违反了犹太法，并警告可能会破坏婚姻。一些年轻正统派男性称Sash女士为**shiksa**，这是对异教女性的贬义意义。

Many women however, including Ms Berkowitz, don’t quite know what to make of the protest. Louder voices are against it. Herschel Schacter, a prominent rabbi who runs the rabbinical school at Yeshiva University, declared the strike to be a violation of Jewish law and warned it could wreck marriages. Some young Orthodox men are calling Ms Sash a *shiksa*, a derogatory Yiddish term for a gentile woman.

在亚里士多芬的《女权志》中，对肉体的剥夺迅速令希腊男性难以忍受。该剧以一群充满欲望的家伙们促成了雅典和斯巴达之间的停战作为结束。Sash女士希望达成自己的和平协议——希望在星期五黄昏安息日降临之前，Berkowitz女士可以获得自由。

In the story of Aristophanes’s “Lysistrata” the carnal deprivation quickly becomes too much for the Greek men to bear. The play concludes with a lustful bunch of blokes brokering a truce between Athens and Sparta, just as the women demanded. Ms Sash hopes for her own sort of peace deal—that Ms Berkowitz be freed before the Sabbath sets in at dusk on Friday.

当被问及未来是否计划再次使用这种策略时，她表示她没有打算激起更多“女权主义恐怖”。重点是教育下一代宗教女孩，如果传统抗议方式失败，她们可以寻找新的方式。 ■

Asked if she plans to use this tactic in the future, she says she does not intend to incite more “feminist terror”. The point is instead to teach the next generation of religious girls that if conventional methods of protest fail, they can find new ones. ■

《沙丘》是对政治英雄及其部落的一种警示 (“Dune” is a warning about political heroes and their tribes)
==============================================================================

它对人性的无情怀疑有助于解释它长久的吸引力 (Its ruthless scepticism of human nature helps explain its enduring appeal)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![插图，一只大象和一只驴子观看《沙丘》](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_USD001.jpg)

弗兰克·赫伯特是科幻小说《沙丘》的作者，《沙丘》也是一部新的票房大片的基础，他会乐于得知，俄勒冈海岸边的生态学家们正在拔除入侵的欧洲沙滩草。赫伯特在20世纪50年代末曾是一名年轻的记者，从观察生态学家们种植草来控制侵蚀沙丘的过程中，汲取灵感，创作了关于一个沙漠星球的故事。这个方案取得了成功，也许成功得有点过头了：那些因为这种草而繁荣的沿海城镇的居民现在渴望回归沙丘的美丽，后悔因此对当地的植物和动物造成了意想不到的后果。

Frank Herbert, the author of the science-fiction novel “Dune” on which a new blockbuster film is based, would have been amused to learn that ecologists along the Oregon shore are ripping invasive European beachgrass out of the ground. As a young journalist in the late 1950s, Herbert derived his inspiration for a tale about a desert planet from watching ecologists plant the grass to control encroaching sand dunes. The scheme worked, maybe too well: residents of the coastal towns that the grass helped prosper now long for the beauty of the dunes and regret the unintended consequences for native flora and fauna.

“他们阻止了沙漠的移动”是赫伯特从未发表的关于俄勒冈沙丘的文章的标题。他钦佩这些生态学家及其项目。但尽管他珍视人类的智慧，他仍担心人类的傲慢、轻信和其他脆弱。小说《沙丘》中的一个人物是一个行星生态学家，由于各种复杂的原因——小说中没有其他一种——发现自己被他一直试图操纵的自然过程所制服，以改变气候来帮助当地居民。“当他的星球毁灭了他时，”赫伯特写道，生态学家反思道，科学家们完全错了，“宇宙最持久的法则是偶然和错误。”

“They stopped the moving sands” was the title of the article Herbert never wound up publishing about the Oregon dunes. He admired the ecologists and their project. But as much as he prized human intelligence he feared human hubris, credulousness and other frailties. One character in “Dune” is a planetary ecologist, who, for complicated reasons—the novel has no other kind—finds himself overcome by natural processes he has been trying to manipulate, to help the native population by changing the climate. “As his planet killed him,” Herbert writes, the ecologist reflects that scientists have it all wrong, and “that the most persistent principles of the universe were accident and error.”

《沙丘》本身的持久性也是个奇迹。在1965年，有约20家出版商拒绝了这份手稿，最终是以汽车维修手册著称的Chilton公司出版了这部作品。由于最初销量不佳，接下风险的编辑被解雇了。但随后，《沙丘》开始受到广泛的赞扬和影响，最终使其成为科幻小说中最畅销和最有影响力的作品之一，其中一些想象力，尽管被磨去了锋芒，仍在《星球大战》中曝光。

The persistence of “Dune” itself is a marvel. Some 20 publishers turned the manuscript down before a company known for auto-repair manuals, Chilton, released it in 1965. The editor who took the risk was fired because sales were slow at first. But popular and critical acclaim began to build, eventually making “Dune” among the best-selling and most influential of science-fiction novels, some of its imaginings, with their edges filed down, surfacing in “Star Wars”.

毫无疑问，这部小说的持久性部分应归功于赫伯特的成功，像托尔金一样，他成功地将史诗故事包裹在无数相互交织的细节中。他在小说中还发布了附录：词汇表、有关争霸的封建家族指南、银河宗教研究，当然还有一篇关于他的沙漠星球阿拉基斯的生态学论文，即被称为《沙丘》的星球。那里的生态产生一种叫作香料的物质，它延长寿命并提供心灵力量，使航行员们能够在星际间引导飞船：可以想象成具有阿德拉尔和奥塞帕的特性的可饮用汽油。这是宇宙中最珍贵的物质。

No doubt the novel’s endurance owes in part to Herbert’s success, like Tolkien’s, in wrapping an epic yarn within a spectacular vision given substance by countless interlocking details. He published appendices to his novel: a glossary, a guide to the feudal houses that jostle over his imperium, a study of the galactic religions and, of course, a paper on the ecology of his desert planet, Arrakis, known as Dune. That ecology yields a substance called spice that prolongs life and also supplies psychic powers, enabling navigators to guide ships among the stars: think potable petrol with the properties of Adderall and Ozempic. It is the most precious stuff in the universe.

年轻的英雄保罗·亚特雷德在他的父亲，一位公爵，被授予在阿拉基斯的控制权时抵达那里。这是一个由皇帝和一个敌对家族设下的圈套。他的父亲死了，他的幸存盟友四散了，保罗和他的母亲逃入沙漠，在那里找到了强悍的弗利门人的庇护。随着香料开启保罗潜在的心灵力量，当地人将他视为他们的救世主，并且——剧透！——不仅带领他们复仇他的父亲，还通过控制香料，夺取皇位。然后出现了一点糟糕的事情，银河圣战。后文继续讨论这一点。

The young hero, Paul Atreides, arrives on Arrakis when his father, a duke, is awarded control there. It is a trap set by the emperor and a rival house. His father dead and his surviving allies scattered, Paul flees with his mother into the desert and finds haven among its fierce people, the Fremen. As the spice unlocks latent mental powers in Paul, the natives recognise him as their messiah and—spoilers!—he leads them not just to avenge his father but, via control of the spice, to seize the imperial throne. Then comes a bit of a bummer, galactic jihad. More on that in a moment.

赫伯特在一定程度上考虑到了T·E·劳伦斯、石油、殖民掠夺和伊斯兰教，小说的成功也可能归因于那些回响（以及巨大的沙虫）。但这部小说持久受欢迎的原因似乎更在于更具永恒共鸣的地方。赫伯特的银河系中有巧妙的小装置，但巧妙的构思使它们不至于占据主导地位，使他的未来不会过于陌生或像其他几十年前的未来愉快过时。个人力场使弹药武器变得无害。士兵和贵族都会用剑、匕首和拳头来战斗。

Herbert was thinking partly of T.E. Lawrence, oil, colonial predation and Islam, and the success of the novel may owe also to those echoes (along with the giant sandworms). But the novel’s enduring popularity suggests more timeless resonances. There are nifty gizmos in Herbert’s galaxy, but clever conceits keep them from stealing the show and making his future either too alien or, like other decades-old visions of the future, amusingly outdated. Personal force-fields have rendered projectile weapons harmless. Soldiers and nobles alike fight with swords, knives and fists.

赫伯特更加引人注目的伎俩是把他的故事设定在“巴特勒起义”或“大革命”数千年后，这场起义中，人类销毁了所有形式的人工智能。（赫伯特曾向一位采访者忧虑，“我们的社会控制技术有把握。”）“不可制造类人思维的机器”，已成为一个核心命令，导致了对发展思维潜能的竞争。保罗的母亲是女性神秘派别——贵族女士们，她们的傲慢企图是操纵帝国的政治，并且数代人一直进行繁殖计划，以诞生出一种超人的智慧——然而,让他们感到惊讶的是，这种超人智慧现身于保罗身上，他们无法控制。

A more provocative gambit by Herbert was to set his tale thousands of years after the “Butlerian Jihad” or “Great Revolt”, in which humans destroyed all forms of artificial intelligence. (Herbert once worried to an interviewer that “our society has a tiger by the tail in technology.”) “Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind,” has become a core injunction, resulting in a race to develop the mind’s potential. Paul’s mother is a member of a female sect, the Bene Gesserit, whose own hubristic enterprise is to manipulate the imperium’s politics, and who for scores of generations have conducted a breeding programme to engender a superhuman intelligence—which, to their consternation, arrives in the form of Paul, whom they cannot control.

新的《沙丘》电影是导演丹尼·维伦纽夫拍摄的两部中的第二部，他以惊人的画面和对小说的忠实大部分展现了故事。这些电影以暗示性地处理赫伯特的技术、经济和生态变化主题，重点放在他的主题上，即政治和宗教权力的危险以及信仰本身，无论是世俗的还是精神的。

The new Dune movie is the second of two in which the director, Denis Villeneuve, has told the story with breathtaking imagery and, for the most part, with fidelity to the novel. The films deal elliptically with Herbert’s themes of technological, economic and ecological change to zero in on his main matter, the dangers of political and religious power and of faith itself, secular or spiritual.

保罗的力量使他能够看到许多未来，尽管他抵制自己作为救世主的角色以及他知道将随之而来的狂血，但最终他接受了这条道路。赫伯特，于1986年去世，曾在1981年对一位采访者表示，他认为约翰·F·肯尼迪是他那个时代最危险的领导人之一，“不是因为这个人是邪恶的，而是因为人们不会对他提出质疑”。在《沙丘》中，坏人是如此之坏，好人有太多的美德，他们面临如此悲剧性的抉择，以至于人们很难认识到他们也不那么伟大。赫伯特的初衷是引诱读者为一个暴君加油。他希望让他们谨慎不仅仅是控制的意志，也包括向统治者屈服的渴望。

Paul’s powers allow him to see many futures, and though he resists his role as messiah and the bloodlust he knows will come with it, he embraces that path in the end. Herbert, who died in 1986, told an interviewer in 1981 that he thought John F. Kennedy was among the most dangerous leaders of his times, “not because the man was evil, but because people didn’t question him”. In “Dune”, the bad guys are so bad, and the good guys have so many virtues and face such tragic choices, it can be hard to recognise they are not so great, either. Herbert set out to lure readers into rooting for a tyrant. He wanted to leave them wary not only of the will to dominate but of the longing to submit.

在电影中，观众得到了解脱。小说中弗莱明领袖原本强悍，但在电影中则变成了一个傻气的狂热者，疯狂地相信保罗，在对比中表现了保罗的弗莱明情人查尼。与小说中不同的是，她成为了民主抵抗的代言人。观众非常容易与查尼产生共鸣。当然，他们也会进行抵抗。当然，他们永远不会轻信于任何部落，永远不会迷恋于任何有魅力的领袖。也许至少一些人会在离开影院时自问这是否确实如此。 ■

Here the film lets the audience off the hook. A Fremen leader, strong-minded in the novel, becomes a clownish fanatic frantic to believe in Paul, in counterpoint to Paul’s Fremen lover, Chani. Contrary to the novel, she emerges as the voice of democratic resistance to Paul’s megalomania. Chani is all too easy for the audience to identify with. Of course they would resist, too. Of course they would never credulously identify with any tribe, never fall for any charismatic leader. Maybe at least some will leave the theatre asking themselves if that is really the case. ■

俄勒冈州废除刑事罪实验终结 (Time is called on Oregon’s decriminalisation experiment)
====================================================================

新方案可能是他们应该从一开始就采取的地方。 (The replacement might be where they should have started)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

![一位在俄勒冈波特兰使用芬太尼的人](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_USP003.jpg)

花店通常都是愉快的地方。但是在波特兰市中心的吉福德花店最近经历了不少困扰。吉姆·吉福德经营这家店已经有半个世纪了，他说，这家店已经遭到三次入室盗窃，员工们甚至遭到袭击和咬伤。吉姆指责俄勒冈州对毒品持有的非刑事化措施，他表示，这导致更多“陷入**毒品**问题”的人来到他的店铺。“一个蓝色城市位于蓝色州份，本应该发挥领导作用，”这位终身持进步民主党人表示。“但同时也不能忘记那些勤劳遵纪守法的人。”

Florists are usually cheerful places. But Gifford’s Flowers, in downtown Portland, has been going through it of late. It’s been broken into three times and employees have been attacked and even bitten, says Jim Gifford, who has been running the store for half a century. Mr Gifford blames Oregon’s decriminalisation of the possession of drugs, which, he says, has led to more “people in drug episodes” coming to his shop. “A blue city in a blue state should be leading,” the lifelong progressive Democrat says. “But also not forgetting about the people that work hard and play by the rules.”

2020年，俄勒冈州民众投票决定将拥有少量**毒品**，包括芬太尼、甲基安非他明和海洛因非刑事化。这是全美国首个（也是迄今唯一）这样做的州。这一变化是一项大胆的试验，将成瘾视为公共卫生问题。但州政府现在得出结论，这次试验失败了。在面对不断增加的过量服用率以及吉夏德先生等公众抱怨之际，民主党控制下的州立法机构以压倒多数通过了一项重新将拥有**毒品**定为刑事犯罪的措施。州长蒂娜·科特克表示她将予以签署。

In 2020 Oregonians voted to decriminalise the possession of small amounts of hard drugs, including fentanyl, methamphetamine and heroin. It was the first (and so far only) state in the country to do so. The change was a massive experiment in treating addiction as a public-health problem. But the state has now concluded that the experiment failed. This month, in the face of ever-increasing overdose rates and public complaints such as Mr Gifford’s, the Democratic-controlled legislature overwhelmingly passed a measure recriminalising the possession of drugs. The governor, Tina Kotek, has said she will sign it.

在俄勒冈州，过量服用死亡人数激增，2023年9月的一年内增加了42%（而全国平均增幅为2%）。研究人员对非刑事化与芬太尼扩散究竟有多大责任存在分歧，但没有人认为该州的试验成功降低了死亡率。俄勒冈居民感到沮丧。露天毒品使用变得尤为明目张胆。

Overdose deaths have spiked in Oregon, increasing by 42% in the year to September 2023 (compared with a national increase of 2%). Researchers disagree on how much decriminalisation versus the spread in fentanyl is to blame, but none thinks that the state’s experiment managed to decrease deaths. Oregonians are frustrated. Open-air drug use has become particularly blatant.

新的法律将持有少量**毒品**定为轻罪，最高可处以180天监禁。它提供了改变成瘾者命运的途径，通过向毒品犯提供直接前往戒毒设施的机会，而不是送进监狱（如果第一次尝试失败，还可以再试一次）。波特兰戒毒服务机构中心城市关怀负责人安迪·门登霍尔告诉立法者：“现在是重设我们的监护栏的时候。”他指出，有人发现在监狱和治疗之间做出选择是“他们康复道路中的一个重要部分”。

The replacement law makes the possession of a small amount of drugs a misdemeanour crime punishable by up to 180 days in jail. It does provide paths to addiction care, by offering drug offenders the chance to go directly to detox facilities instead of jail (and to try it again if the first time doesn’t work). “It’s time to reset our guardrails,” Andy Mendenhall, the head of Central City Concern, an addiction-services provider in Portland, told lawmakers. He pointed to people who found choosing between prison and treatment to be a “powerful part of their pathway of recovery”.

马里恩县地方检察官佩奇·克拉克森赞扬这项法案，她相信新规定将使检察官能够专注于贩毒分子，同时优先为成瘾者提供治疗。“警察、治安官、地方检察官，我们不想将成瘾罪化，”她表示。“我们希望使用刑法来激励这些人变得健康。”俄勒冈的新体制仍将是相当富有开明性的。

Praising the bill, Paige Clarkson, the district attorney in Marion County, believes that the new provisions will allow prosecutors to focus on drug dealers while prioritising treatment for addicts. “Police, sheriff’s deputies, district attorneys, we don’t want to criminalise addiction,” she says. “We want to use the criminal laws to motivate those individuals to get healthy.” Oregon’s new regime would still be quite enlightened.

但即便如此，该州的毒品试验可能仍将成为一个警示故事，州参议员弗洛伊德·普罗赞斯基表示。尽管他仍坚信这一使命，普罗赞斯基也意识到，倡导者们需要“重建人们对俄勒冈州以及全国的信心，并意识到我们在实施时犯了错误。” ■

But its drug experiment is likely to become a cautionary tale anyway, says Floyd Prozanski, the state senator who led the charge in enacting it. Although he still believes in the mission, Mr Prozanski recognises that advocates are going to “have to rebuild the confidence of people not only in Oregon, but around the country. And realise that when we implemented it, we did it wrong.” ■

美国最佳医疗保健数据集访问将更加困难 (The best dataset on American health care will be harder to access)
===================================================================================

这将阻碍研究 (This will hold back research)
----------------------------------

![一辆救护车运送一个人。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_USP505.jpg)

芝加哥大学的卫生政策研究员Prachi Sanghavi研究了现场提供医疗服务的**救护车**是否比仅仅将患者匆匆送往医院的基本**救护车**效果更好。（并非如此。）她还研究了联邦政府针对养老院质量的评分系统是否有效。（也是否定的。）她的研究帮助美国人评估该国的医疗保健政策。不幸的是，她的工作目前面临风险。

Prachi Sanghavi, a health-policy researcher at the University of Chicago, studies whether ambulances that provide medical care at the site of the emergency are better than basic ones that simply rush a patient to the hospital. (They are not.) She also studies whether the federal government’s rating system for nursing home quality is any good. (That’s a no, too). Her research helps Americans evaluate the country’s health-care practices. Unfortunately her work is now at risk.

Sanghavi博士的研究使用了由美国公共卫生保险机构——医疗保险和医疗补助服务中心（CMS）提供的数据。CMS在二月份宣布计划改变其数据共享方式。该提案提高了数据费用，并使获取数据变得不太方便。来自美国75多个机构的近400名研究人员，包括Sanghavi博士在内，签署了一封抗议信。他们声称新的限制将危及开创性的研究。

Dr Sanghavi’s research uses data provided by the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal health-care agency that administers America’s public-health insurance. CMS announced plans in February to change its data-sharing practices. The proposal raises the fees for data and makes access less convenient. Nearly 400 researchers, including Dr Sanghavi, from over 75 institutions across America have signed a letter in protest. They claim that the new restrictions will jeopardise ground-breaking research.

由于美国没有国家卫生记录系统，因此CMS的数据是目前最好的数据。超过三分之一的美国人由CMS提供覆盖，每年有超过10亿项医疗索赔通过该机构处理。这使得该机构成为研究医疗保健私有化到阿片类药物流行病原因等各种问题的研究宝库。

America does not have a national health-records system, so the CMS numbers are the best data available. Over a third of Americans are covered by CMS, and over 1bn medical claims a year are processed through the agency. This makes it a trove for researchers studying anything from health-care privatisation to the causes of the opioid epidemic.

该机构表示改变规则是出于对数据安全的担忧。表面上看，这听起来是合理的。CMS去年刚刚遭遇过数据泄露事件。超过60万人的敏感个人信息，如社会安全号码和通讯地址，遭遇泄露。上个月，一家被美国大型私人保险公司联合健康集团收购的医疗支付公司Change Healthcare也成为攻击目标。

The agency says it is changing the rules over concerns for data security. On the face of it, that sounds reasonable. CMS had a data breach just last year. Sensitive personal information, such as social-security numbers and mailing addresses, was compromised for over 600,000 people. Last month Change Healthcare, a health-care payment company bought by UnitedHealth Group, a large private insurer, was also targeted.

根据当前的数据共享模式，研究人员可以收到CMS数据的实体副本。然后他们负责保护数据安全，KFF卫生政策智库的研究员Alice Burns解释道。与被黑客攻击的CMS数据不同，研究人员的数据不包含个人姓名和社会安全号码。

Under the current model of data-sharing, researchers can receive physical copies of the CMS data. They are then responsible for keeping the data secure, explains Alice Burns, a researcher at KFF, a health-policy think-tank. Unlike the CMS data that were hacked, the data for researchers do not contain individual names and social-security numbers.

但是，它们包含诊断和一个人的年龄、种族和邮政编码等敏感信息。乔治亚州立大学研究网络安全的David Maimon说，在某些情况下，一名决心的黑客可能会识别出个人，但这种可能性极小。拟议的政策要求研究人员改而使用CMS托管的虚拟中心。

However, they do contain sensitive information such as health diagnoses and a person’s age, race and zip code. In some instances a determined hacker could be able to identify an individual, but it is highly unlikely, says David Maimon of Georgia State University, who studies cyber-security. The proposed policy requires researchers to switch instead to a virtual centre hosted by CMS.

这涉及到权衡风险和利益，LexisNexis风险解决方案公司的Haywood Talcove表示。在这种情况下，计算似乎是失衡的。由于CMS之前遭受过黑客攻击，在那里囤积数据并不能使其更加安全。

This is about balancing risk and benefit, says Haywood Talcove of LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a firm that sells fraud-prevention services. In this case the calculus seems lopsided. Since CMS has been hacked before, hoarding the data there doesn’t make it secure.

研究人员表示，当前模型的好处远远超过安全风险。抗议的科学家声称，不太知名的研究人员和处于较差学术机构的人可能会失去数据获取的机会。特朗普政府时期CMS前幕僚长Paul Mango提问：“我们为什么不邀请全球最优秀的公共卫生专家来查看我们所拥有的数据呢？”

The researchers say that the benefits of the current model far outweigh the security risks. The protesting scientists claim that less-established researchers and those at poorer academic institutions could lose access. “Why wouldn’t we invite the best public-health experts in the world to look at the same data that we have?” asks Paul Mango, a former chief of staff at CMS under the Trump administration.

一切尚未尘埃落定。这些改变尚未生效，该机构将在5月15日之前接受研究人员的反馈。但目前，研究人员希望保持现状。由于绝大多数老年人接受的是医疗保险，这些数据提供了“一个人一生美妙的纵观”，Sanghavi博士说。这种价值难以估量。 ■

All is not lost. The changes have yet to go into effect, and the agency is accepting feedback from researchers until May 15th. But for now, the researchers would like to keep the status quo. Since the vast majority of older adults are on Medicare, these numbers give “a beautiful longitudinal view of a person’s life”, says Dr Sanghavi. It’s hard to put a price on that. ■

美铁的乘客量达到历史新高 (Amtrak’s ridership is touching record highs)
=======================================================

但疫情后的复苏能持续下去吗？ (But is the post-pandemic recovery sustainable?)
------------------------------------------------------------

![一列火车驶出有着148年历史的巴尔的摩和波托马克隧道。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_USP508.jpg)

星期五晚上7点，从伊利诺伊州南部开往芝加哥的伊利尼服务列车本应抵达千梦大学城。今年三月初，当贵报记者乘坐该列车时，由于对向列车故障，列车被迫提前停车。在隧道以南大约200码处，乘客们被困了三个小时。一个学生开始轰轰烈烈地向列车员抱怨，后来悄悄打开门走进夜晚。大约晚上10点，列车最终缓缓驶入站台，其余乘客也陆续下车。第二天早晨，状况尚可的记者最终乘坐巴士前往芝加哥。

At 7pm on a Friday night, the Illini service, a train that runs from southern Illinois to Chicago, ought to be pulling into the college city of Champaign. When your correspondent was on it in early March, it stopped short after the train coming in the opposite direction broke down. For three hours, passengers were trapped roughly 200 yards south of the station. At some point a student who had been loudly complaining to the conductor quietly opened the door and walked off into the night. A little after 10pm the train finally shunted its way to the platform and the rest of the passengers alighted. The next morning your by now rather grumpy correspondent proceeded to Chicago by bus.

这样的乘火车旅行故事在美国并不罕见。作为世界上最大的经济体，美国的电气化铁路里程比伊朗还少。唯一在波士顿到华盛顿特区之间的东北走廊，城际列车运行方式略微类似其他富裕国家。在其他地方，拒绝使用汽车或搭乘飞机的门诺派教徒构成了相当大比例的乘客。尽管情况看似黯淡，然而全国铁路运营商Amtrak实际上正在从疫情中恢复良好。去年下半年，乘客量仅比2019年（该公司迄今为止最佳年份）水平低3%。乔•拜登总统作为参议员时是Amtrak的忠实用户，通过了2021年的基础设施法案，拨出660亿美元用于投资城际铁路基础设施。新的火车旅行黄金时代即将到来吗？

Such stories of travelling by train in America are sadly common. The world’s biggest economy has fewer miles of electrified railway than Iran. Only in the North East Corridor (NEC) between Boston and Washington, DC, do intercity trains run even vaguely like trains in other rich countries. Elsewhere, Mennonites, who do not use cars or fly, make up a remarkable share of passengers. And yet as bleak as it can seem, Amtrak, the national rail carrier, is in fact recovering well from the pandemic. In the latter half of last year, ridership was just 3% below its levels in 2019—previously the firm’s best-ever year. And through his infrastructure law of 2021 President Joe Biden, an Amtrak superuser as a senator, has put aside $66bn for investment in passenger-rail infrastructure. Is a new golden age of train travel down the tracks?

目前最大的恢复在东北走廊，这是由Amtrak直接拥有和维护的电气化铁轨。2023年，该地列车载客达到创纪录的1270万人次，约占Amtrak总客流的43%。在东北部，列车得到广泛使用，因为它们连接了人口稠密的城市中心并且比其他交通方式更舒适。经常乘坐波士顿、纽约和华盛顿之间的常客迈尔斯•斯坦利表示，“比飞行更愉快，更舒适。”该走廊上的票务收入轻松覆盖了列车运营成本，并创造了用于维护的盈余资金。

The biggest recovery at the moment is on the NEC, an electrified track largely-owned and maintained by Amtrak directly. In 2023 trains there carried 12.7m people, a record high, and about 43% of all Amtrak passengers in total. The trains are well used in the north-east because they connect dense city centres and are nicer than the alternatives. “It’s more enjoyable and more comfortable” than flying, says Miles Stanley, a regular passenger between Boston, New York and Washington. Ticket revenues on the corridor easily cover the cost of operating the trains, and generate a surplus used for maintenance.

在其他地方，长途线路要么得到国会的直接补贴，要么得到各州政府的资助，而列车通常行驶在由货运公司拥有的铁路上，频率太低。这些列车的乘客数量也在恢复，但恢复速度远远低于东北走廊。随着老化车辆的问题，这些旅程往往越来越糟糕。出轨事件极为普遍，路口相撞也屡有发生。记者曾经在长途列车“新奥尔良之城”上由于冻结的汽笛而被延误数小时。

Elsewhere, rail is either directly subsidised by Congress (for the long-distance lines) or by state governments (for the rest), and trains travel on tracks owned by freight companies, all too infrequently. Passenger numbers are recovering on those trains too, but far less fast than on the NEC. It does not help that ageing rolling stock means those journeys are often getting worse. Derailments are absurdly common, as are crashes at level crossings. Your correspondent was once delayed several hours on the City of New Orleans, a long-distance train, by a frozen whistle.

如果Amtrak是一家正常公司，它会向东北走廊投入资金，减少或停止那些亏损的长途列车。然而，作为乘客的游说团体铁路乘客协会的主席吉姆•马修斯指出，Amtrak更像是政府机构而非公司。它的领导由总统任命，每年必须由国会拨款。因此，该公司一般倾向于在全国各地分配资金以赢得政治支持。目前，Amtrak已在美国的46个低于48个州开展业务，在251个国会选区存在。“这有点愤世嫉俗，”马修斯先生承认。

If Amtrak were a normal company, it would pour money into the NEC and run fewer loss-making long-distance trains. Yet as Jim Mathews, the president of the Rail Passengers Association, a lobby group for riders, is keen to point out, Amtrak is more like a government agency than a company. Its bosses are appointed by the president and each year it has to be funded by Congress. And so the firm has generally tended to spread money around the country to win political support. Already it operates in 46 of the lower 48 states, and in 251 congressional districts. “It is a little cynical,” Mr Mathews admits.

目前，公司有足够的资金同时投资两方面。在东北走廊，一个靠近巴尔的摩的南北战争时代的隧道正在重建，这是几十年前就应该进行的工作。在长途线路上，新列车正在采购之中。但根据城市研究所的尤纳•弗里马克指出，2026年必须重新获得授权进行投资支出。另一个风险是，基础设施法案规定的资金只能用于投资，而不能用于运营成本。去年，众议院共和党人提议将Amtrak的日常预算削减64%，如果实施，将使投资成为无意义的行为。

For now, there is so much money around that the firm can invest in both. On the NEC, a civil-war-era tunnel near Baltimore where trains have to slow to a crawl is being rebuilt, something that ought to have happened decades ago. On the long-distance lines, new trains are being procured. But investment spending must be re-authorised in 2026, notes Yonah Freemark, of the Urban Institute, a think-tank. Another risk is that infrastructure-act money by law can be spent only on investment, not operational costs. Last year House Republicans proposed a 64% cut to Amtrak’s day-to-day budget—which if carried out would make investment pointless.

一些铁路爱好者有更宏大的构想。3月8日，来自马萨诸塞州的国会议员赛斯•莫尔顿提出了一项法案，提议在高速铁路上投资2050亿美元。他担心Amtrak“试图重建上世纪30年代的服务。”相反，他认为应该建设一条全新的快速列车线路，就像日本或法国那样。他表示，这个新线路应该在得克萨斯州建成。“展示高速铁路可以在一个红色州取得成功并获得大量共和党支持将改变对话的方向，”他说。事实上，Amtrak正在与莫尔顿先生曾经供职的一家公司合作提出类似计划。这无疑是一个起点。■

Some rail boosters have bigger ideas. On March 8th Seth Moulton, a congressman from Massachusetts, filed a bill proposing $205bn in investment in high-speed rail. He worries that Amtrak is “trying to recreate services from the 1930s”. Instead, he says it ought to build a brand-new fast train line, of the sort the Japanese or French have. This, he says, should be in Texas. “Showing that high-speed rail can succeed in a red state and get a lot of Republican support would change the conversation,” he says. Indeed Amtrak is working on a proposal to do just that, in partnership with a firm Mr Moulton used to work for. It’s certainly a platform. ■

沙特阿美公司对原油失去热情了吗? (Is Saudi Aramco cooling on crude oil?)
=====================================================

别抱有幻想 (Don’t bet on it)
--------------------

![Pipelines in the Shaybah field at the northern edge of the Empty Quarter desert in Saudi Arabia.](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_WBP501.jpg)

HAS SAUDI ARABIA stopped believing in a future for petroleum? In recent weeks the question has hung over Saudi Aramco. The desert kingdom’s [national oil goliath](https://www.economist.com/business/why-saudi-aramco-could-be-eclipsed-by-its-qatari-nemesis/21808310) has a central position in the world’s oil markets. Its market value of $2trn, five times that of the second-biggest oil firm, ExxonMobil, is predicated on bountiful reserves of crude and a peerless ability to tap them cheaply and, as oil goes, cleanly. So the Saudi energy ministry stunned many industry-watchers in January by suspending the firm’s plans to expand oil-production capacity from 12m to 13m barrels per day (b/d). Did the kingpin of crude finally accept that [oil demand](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2024/03/11/the-end-of-oil-then-and-now) would soon peak?

沙特阿拉伯是否不再相信石油的未来？近几周以来，这个问题一直困扰着沙特阿拉伯油公司。这个沙漠王国的**国家石油巨头**在世界石油市场中占据着核心位置。其市值2万亿美元，是全球第二大石油公司埃克森美孚的五倍，这取决于其丰富的原油储备以及无与伦比的廉价、环保开采能力。因此，沙特能源部一月份悬挂该公司将原油产能从每日1200万桶增加到1300万桶的扩张计划，让许多行业观察者感到震惊。难道这个原油巨头终于接受了石油需求即将达到顶峰的事实？

For an anwser, all eyes turned to Aramco’s results for 2023, reported on March 10th. No one expected a repeat of the year before, when high oil prices and surging demand propelled its annual net profit to $161bn, the highest ever for a listed firm. But analysts and investors were still interested in the extent of the decline in revenue and profit, in any changes to capital-spending plans and, possibly, in the unveiling of an all-new strategy.

要找到答案，所有人的目光都转向了阿美（Aramco）的2023年财报，这份报告于3月10日发布。没有人预料到会重演前一年的情况，当时高油价和激增的需求推动其年度净利润达到了1610亿美元，创下上市公司历史最高利润。但分析师和投资者仍然关注收入和利润下降的程度，是否有资本开支计划的变化，以及可能推出全新战略。

Profits did fall, to $121bn, though that was still the second-best tally in Aramco’s history. Thanks to a recently introduced special dividend, the firm paid nearly $100bn to shareholders last year, 30% more than amid the bonanza of 2022, and promised to hand over even more in 2024.

利润确实下降，降至1210亿美元，但这仍是阿美历史上第二好的业绩。由于最近推出的特别股息，该公司去年向股东支付了近1千亿美元，比2022年的繁荣时期多30%，并承诺在2024年支付更多。

Shovelling a larger chunk of a smaller haul to owners could, on its own, imply that Aramco is indeed less gung-ho about its oily future. Except that the rich dividend was accompanied by two developments that point in the opposite direction. First, Aramco is rumoured to be preparing a secondary share offering that could raise perhaps $20bn in the coming months—a move typically associated with expansion rather than contraction. Second, more tangibly, it is ramping up capital spending. Investments rose from less than $40bn in 2022 to some $50bn last year. In a call with analysts on March 11th Aramco confirmed that suspending the planned capacity expansion will save around $40bn in capital spending between now and 2028. But, it added, this does not mean it is not investing. On the contrary, the aim is to spend between $48bn and $58bn in 2025, and maybe more in the few years after that.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_WBC770.png)

将更小规模的一部分赢利分配给所有者可能意味着阿美的对油腥未来信心减弱。不过，这笔丰厚的股息还伴随着两项显示出另一方向的发展。首先，据传闻，阿美正在筹备第二次股份发行，可能在未来几个月内筹集约200亿美元资金，这通常与扩张而非收缩相关联。其次，更具体地，公司正在加大资本开支。投资从2022年的不足400亿美元增至去年的约500亿美元。在3月11日与分析师的电话会议上，阿美确认中止计划中的产能扩张将节省约400亿美元的资本支出，直至2028年。但公司补充说，这并不意味着停止投资。相反，目标是在2025年投资480亿至580亿美元，并可能在此后几年投入更多。

A bit of that money will go to clean projects such as hydrogen, carbon capture and renewables. Some will go to cleanish ones, such as expanding Aramco’s natural-gas production by over 60% from its level of 2021 by 2030, and backing liquefied-natural-gas ventures abroad. But most is aimed at ensuring that Aramco can maintain its ability to pump up to 12m b/d of crude. Given its actual output of around 9m b/d (see chart), this does not hobble its ability to move markets. If anything, it strengthens Aramco’s position, for it implies spare capacity of 3m b/d—above the firm’s historic average of 2m-2.5m b/d, according to Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy. Aramco is, in other words, committed both to pumping oil and to preserving Saudi Arabia’s role as the market’s swing producer.

这些资金中的一部分将用于清洁项目，如氢能、碳捕获和可再生能源。一部分将用于相对清洁的项目，如将阿美的天然气产量到2030年提高60%以上，以及支持国外液化天然气项目。但大部分旨在确保阿美能够维持每天生产1200万桶原油的能力。鉴于其实际产量约为每天900万桶（见图表），这并没有限制其左右市场的能力。相反，这加强了阿美的地位，因为这意味着其有300万桶的剩余产能——根据咨询公司伍德麦肯齐的说法，这超过了公司历史上2百万至2.5百万桶的平均剩余产能。换句话说，阿美既致力于增产石油，也致力于保持沙特阿拉伯作为市场摇摆生产者的地位。

That is in part because it is also committed to pumping money into the economic vision for Saudi Arabia championed by Muhammad bin Salman, the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler. This became more evident on March 7th, when Aramco announced the transfer of 8% of its shares, worth $164bn, out of the hands of the government and into the Public Investment Fund (PIF), a vehicle for Saudi sovereign wealth which Prince Muhammad has tasked with [diversifying the economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/03/14/saudi-arabias-investment-fund-has-been-set-an-impossible-task). This leaves the PIF with 16% of Aramco, compared with the 2% or so that is owned by minority shareholders (the rest remains directly in the government’s hands).

部分原因是公司也致力于将资金投入到沙特阿拉伯的经济愿景中，这一愿景由沙特王储兼事实上的统治者穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼（Muhammad bin Salman）倡导。这在3月7日更加明显，当时阿美宣布将价值1,640亿美元的8%股份从政府手中转移给沙特主权财富的公共投资基金（PIF），这是穆罕默德王储交给其任务的一个旗舰项目，旨在[促进经济多元化](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/03/14/saudi-arabias-investment-fund-has-been-set-an-impossible-task)。这使得PIF持有阿美16%的股份，较之少数股东所持有的大约2%左右更多（而其余仍然直接由政府掌握）。

Saudi Arabia’s plans to suspend the expansion of production capacity do not, then, reflect a U-turn away from hydrocarbons. Rather, the pause is born of a hard-headed assessment of market realities: a surge in oil production in the Americas, soft demand in China and cuts to output from the OPEC cartel (of which Saudi Arabia is a member). As Amin Nasser, Aramco’s chief executive, summed it up in the results presentation, “Oil and gas will be a key part of the global energy mix for many decades to come, alongside new energy solutions.” And so will Aramco. ■

因此，沙特阿拉伯暂停扩大产能的计划并非意味着放弃化石燃料的转向。相反，这个暂停源于对市场现实的理性评估：美洲石油产量激增、中国需求疲软以及石油输出减少（沙特阿拉伯为石油输出国组织的成员）。正如阿美的首席执行官阿敏·纳瑟（Amin Nasser）在业绩发布会上总结的那样，“石油和天然气将在未来几十年中成为全球能源组合的关键组成部分，与新能源解决方案并存。”阿美也将如此。■

TikTok还会存在于美国吗？ (Will TikTok still exist in America?)
==================================================

随着国会开始倒计时禁令，这款应用必须考虑其选择。 (As Congress starts the clock on a ban, the app must consider its options)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![一只手拿着屏幕发亮的智能手机。屏幕上显示着一个问号，上面叠加着TikTok的标志。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_WBD003.jpg)

仔细倾听，你会听到影响者的哀鸣。3月13日，美国众议院通过了一项法案，禁止应用商店和互联网提供商分发“受外国对手控制的应用程序”。目标很明确：TikTok，一款受到1.7亿美国人平均每天56分钟使用的热门短视频应用。

LISTEN CLOSELY and you can hear the influencers wail. On March 13th America’s House of Representatives passed a bill barring app stores and internet providers from distributing “foreign-adversary-controlled applications”. The target is clear: TikTok, a hit short-video app to which 170m Americans are glued for an average of 56 minutes a day.

TikTok在美国的地位一直[岌岌可危](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/12/time-for-tiktok-to-cut-its-ties-to-china)。尽管该公司总部位于洛杉矶和新加坡，但它是中国科技界的一个子公司。这引发了两党担心，认为中国政府可能会利用它来监视美国公民或塑造舆论。TikTok否认中国政府对其具有任何影响，并试图通过邀请美国软件巨头甲骨文来划定美国用户数据并检查其源代码来缓解担忧。该公司指出，美国投资者，如凯雷和通用大西洋公司，是字节跳动的最大股东之一。

TikTok’s position in America [has long been precarious](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/12/time-for-tiktok-to-cut-its-ties-to-china). Although the firm is based in Los Angeles and Singapore, it is a subsidiary of ByteDance, a Chinese tech darling. That has fed bipartisan fears that the Chinese government could use it to spy on American citizens or shape public opinion. TikTok has denied that the Chinese government wields any influence over it, and has sought to assuage concerns by enlisting Oracle, an American software giant, to fence off the data of American users into local servers and inspect its source code. It points out that American investors, such as Carlyle and General Atlantic, are among ByteDance’s biggest shareholders.

如果该法案成为法律，将迫使字节跳动在六个月内出售TikTok的美国业务或关闭这些业务。自TikTok老板周宇进行了上次国会听证以来，推动此举的压力一直在增加。然而，该公司对美国通常沉睡的立法者的行动速度感到措手不及。

If it becomes law, the bill would compel ByteDance either to sell TikTok’s American operations within six months or to shut them down. Pressure for such a move has been building since TikTok’s boss, Shou Zi Chew, was hauled before Congress last March. The firm was nevertheless caught off guard by the speed with which America’s typically sleepy lawmakers have acted.

此提议之所以获得动力，部分原因是对该应用在处理虚假信息和反犹太内容方面的不安，这是在哈马斯去年十月对以色列发动攻击后发生的。TikTok的努力阻挠法案以惊人方式失败。3月6日，该公司向用户发送通知，鼓励他们向国会施加压力反对立法。结果似乎适得其反：一些犹豫不决的立法者被说服认为TikTok确实对选民产生影响。结果，其中352人支持该法案，只有65人表示反对。

The proposal gained momentum partly as a consequence of disquiet over the app’s handling of misinformation and antisemitic content following Hamas’s attack on Israel in October. TikTok’s efforts to stall the bill failed spectacularly. On March 6th it sent a notification encouraging users to lobby Congress against the legislation. That seems to have backfired: some undecided lawmakers were persuaded that TikTok does indeed hold sway over voters. In the event 352 of them backed the bill; only 65 were opposed.

但在总统乔·拜登签署法案（他表示会这么做）之前，该法案必须首先通过参议院。考虑到该法案的两党支持，你可能会认为这只是例行公事。然而并非如此。前总统唐纳德·特朗普，作为总统在2020年几乎迫使TikTok出售，他改变了态度。3月8日，他抱怨称，禁止TikTok将使Meta受益，而Meta是拥有Facebook和Instagram的社交媒体巨头，并且在2021年1月特朗普支持者冲击国会后，Meta将特朗普驱逐出其平台。他介入的动机可能并非完全出于公益。一周前，特朗普与对冲基金亿万富翁、潜在捐赠人杰夫·亚斯会面，而后者投资公司Susquehanna碰巧持有字节跳动的股份。

But before President Joe Biden can sign the bill into law, which he says he will do, it must first pass the Senate. Given its bipartisan popularity you might think this was a formality. Not so. Donald Trump, who as president almost forced TikTok into a sale in 2020, has changed his tune. On March 8th he complained that banning TikTok would benefit Meta, the social-media colossus which owns Facebook and Instagram—and which, unforgivably, exiled Mr Trump from its platforms after his supporters stormed Congress in January 2021. The motivation for his intervention may not be entirely public-spirited. A week earlier Mr Trump met Jeff Yass, a hedge-fund billionaire and prospective donor whose investment firm, Susquehanna, happens to own a stake in ByteDance.

参议院的共和党人可能会跟随特朗普的示范，毕竟他刚刚锁定了本党提名，将参加今年11月的总统选举。林赛·格雷厄姆在3月10日表示，他不确定自己该投票支持还是反对，他既在批评TikTok上喋喋不休，又在恭维特朗普。

Republicans in the Senate may follow Mr Trump’s cue—he has, after all, just sealed their party’s nomination for the presidential election this November. Lindsey Graham, who is both vociferous in his criticisms of TikTok and sycophantic in his adulation for Mr Trump, said on March 10th that he was unsure how he would vote.

如果该法案最终成为法律，很可能会在法庭上面临挑战，可能是基于言论自由的理由。尽管如此，TikTok很有可能需要关闭其在美国的业务。一年前，中国政府表示反对出售。在众议院投票前几个小时，中国指责美国“在无法在公平竞争中成功时诉诸霸道行动”。据报道，字节跳动去年的收入约为1,100亿美元，据信其中大约四分之四来自中国，在那里它经营着TikTok的姊妹应用抖音和新闻聚合应用今日头条。尽管其投资者将游说允许出售，但中国政府可能会表现出不妥协，注定了这家美国企业的厄运。中国还可能需要对在中国内地运营的美国企业进行报复。

If the bill does become law it is likely to face a challenge in the courts, probably on free-speech grounds. Still, there is a reasonable chance that TikTok would have to shut up shop in America. A year ago the Chinese government said it would oppose a sale. Hours before the House vote it denounced America for “resorting to hegemonic moves when one could not succeed in fair competition”. ByteDance, which reportedly generated $110bn of revenue last year, is believed to make around four-fifths of that in China, where it operates TikTok’s sister app, Douyin, and Toutiao, a news aggregator. Although its investors would lobby to allow a sale, China’s government could prove intransigent, dooming the American business. It could also feel the need to retaliate against American firms operating on the mainland.

如果广告商被迫将支出从TikTok转移，美国本土社交媒体公司将获得巨大收益。然而，并非所有公司都会受益相同。根据研究公司Kepios的数据，全球82%的TikTok用户使用Facebook，80%使用Instagram，78%观看YouTube，后者是谷歌母公司Alphabet旗下的产品（见图表）。只有53%使用**推特**这个表论平台，仅35%使用Snapchat，一款消息应用。如果美国人将他们去年在TikTok上花费的大约三万亿分钟的注意力转移到其它已安装在手机上的应用上，那么在线广告领域的主导者Meta和Alphabet将成为赢家。

Were advertisers forced to shift their spending from TikTok, America’s homegrown social-media companies would be in for a windfall. Not all will benefit equally. According to Kepios, a research firm, 82% of global TikTokers use Facebook, 80% scroll Instagram and 78% watch YouTube, which is owned by Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet (see chart). Only 53% use X, the debating forum formerly known as Twitter, and a mere 35% are on Snapchat, a messaging app. If Americans redirect the roughly 3trn minutes of attention they lavished on TikTok last year to other apps already on their phones, Meta and Alphabet, the dominant duo in online advertising, will be the winners.

尽管对Meta抱怨不满，但特朗普抱怨Meta将成为最大的受益者也许有些道理。Instagram嵌入了类似TikTok的Reels功能，这一功能比YouTube和Snapchat的类似功能更受欢迎。许多TikTok影响者已经在Meta的应用上重新发布他们的内容。在中国与印度边境发生冲突之后，印度在2020年禁止了TikTok（以及其他几十个中国应用程序）后，Instagram在该国迅速崛起。2019年，它在印度是第六大下载应用，到2021年已经名列前茅。

His grudge against Meta notwithstanding, Mr Trump may have a point when he grumbles that the firm will be the biggest beneficiary. Reels, a TikTok-like offering embedded into Instagram, has gained more traction than similar ones from YouTube and Snapchat. Many TikTok influencers already repost their content on Meta’s app. After India banned TikTok (and dozens of other Chinese apps) in 2020 following a skirmish on its border with China, Instagram surged in the country. In 2019 it was the sixth-most downloaded app in India. By 2021 it was top of the charts.

如果字节跳动的投资者成功说服中国政府允许分拆，Meta就没有那么幸运了。很可能由于反垄断原因，这家美国公司会被禁止收购TikTok，而Alphabet也会受到同样的限制。潜在的其他竞标者名单受到TikTok的标价限制，如果字节跳动担心在其它国家出现连锁打击，TikTok的标价可能会达到12位数。

Meta will not be so lucky if ByteDance’s investors succeed in persuading China’s government to allow a divestiture. The American firm would doubtless be barred from snapping up TikTok on antitrust grounds, as would Alphabet. The list of other potential suitors is limited by TikTok’s price tag, which could run to 12 figures if ByteDance, fearing knock-on crackdowns elsewhere, throws in TikTok’s operations in other countries.

作为美国的电商巨头，亚马逊可能也会关注TikTok，因为TikTok日益重视将购物融入其应用中（尽管亚马逊也将面临反垄断的压力）。苹果和奈飞，在TikTok在2020年寻求出售时选择放弃了，但考虑到iPhone销售和流媒体订阅增长放缓，它们可能会重新考虑。当时，甲骨文与沃尔玛（一家零售巨头）联手购买了TikTok的少数股份。但在特朗普离职后，这桩交易失败了。在2022年斥资280亿美元收购了医疗记录公司Cerner之后，甲骨文现在可能负债过重，无法发起竞标。

Amazon, America’s e-commerce champion, may take a look, given TikTok’s growing focus on incorporating shopping into its app (though it, too, would face pushback from trustbusters). Apple and Netflix, which both passed when TikTok was sounding out a sale in 2020, could reconsider, given slowing growth in iPhone sales and streaming subscriptions, respectively. Back then Oracle teamed up with Walmart, a retail behemoth, to buy minority stakes in TikTok. But that deal fell through after Mr Trump left office. After its $28bn acquisition in 2022 of Cerner, a health-records business, Oracle is probably now too indebted to mount a bid.

另一家美国科技巨头微软可能会参与其中。四年前，它曾竞购TikTok在美国、澳大利亚、加拿大和新西兰的业务，但由于字节跳动不愿给予其对该应用程序数据和源代码的完全控制而告吹。但该公司长期渴望在消费者生活中占据更重要的地位，这可能会使其回到TikTok，如果字节跳动愿意放宽条件的话。也提出了其他合并建议。据称，动视暴雪的前老板和微软去年收购的一家游戏工作室已向各个合作伙伴，包括ChatGPT的OpenAI的山姆·阿尔特曼，提出了对TikTok的竞标想法。

Microsoft, another American tech titan, could weigh in. Its own bid four years ago to acquire TikTok’s business in America, Australia, Canada and New Zealand ended after ByteDance balked at giving it full control of the app’s data and source code. But the company has long coveted a greater presence in consumers’ lives, which may bring it back to TikTok—if ByteDance were to loosen its terms. Other mashups have also been suggested. Bobby Kotick, former boss of Activision Blizzard, a video-game studio which Microsoft acquired last year, has reportedly pitched the idea of a bid for TikTok to various partners, including Sam Altman of OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT.

然而，随着人工智能竞赛的加剧，中国可能不愿将TikTok的数据或智能算法交给任何美国利益方。一个替代方案是将TikTok作为独立业务进行出售，而不是将其与现有业务合并。这将规避反垄断顾虑。但这笔交易的规模可能再次成为问题。有史以来最大规模的首次公开募股是2019年沙特阿美公司，一家国有石油巨头，筹集了260亿美元的股款。有史以来最大的杠杆收购是2007年以450亿美元收购了实用工具公司TXU。而TikTok的价值将超过这一数字，尽管字节跳动的美国投资者可以将他们的股份交换为这家新公司的股份。

However, as the artificial-intelligence race heats up, it seems doubtful that China would want to hand TikTok’s data or clever algorithm to any American interests. An alternative would be to sell off TikTok as a standalone business rather than merge it with an existing one. This would dodge antitrust concerns. But the deal’s size could again be a problem. The largest amount ever raised in an initial public offering was for a $26bn stake in Saudi Aramco, a state oil leviathan, in 2019. The largest leveraged buy-out in history was that of TXU, a utility, for $45bn in 2007. The value of TikTok would exceed even that, though it helps that ByteDance’s American investors could swap their stakes for a slice of the new company.

假设可以从字节跳动解除关系，一个独立的TikTok将需要雇佣大量技术人员来取代北京的员工。然而，分割可能会带来回报。经纪公司Bernstein的Mark Shmulik认为，在扩大业务方面，这家公司并没有尽其所能，而是试图保持低调。它可以做得更多，以链接其服务器与广告商的服务器，以跟踪其支出的有效性，就像Meta所做的那样，并加快推出TikTok Shop，其电子商务平台。在不到十年的时间里，与中国有关的TikTok已经在美国和其他地区颠覆了社交媒体行业。一个独立的TikTok将继续带来颠覆性影响，如果它被允许存在的话。■

Assuming it can be untangled from Bytedance, an independent TikTok would need to hire plenty of techies to replace the ones in Beijing. Still, a separation could pay off. Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, a broker, reckons that the firm became less aggressive in expanding its business than it could have been, as it sought to keep a low profile. It could do more to link its servers with those of advertisers—the better to track the efficacy of their spending, as Meta has done—and to speed up the roll-out of TikTok Shop, its e-commerce platform. In less than a decade a Chinese-linked TikTok has managed to upend the social-media business in America and beyond. An untethered one would keep being disruptive—if it is allowed to exist. ■

每个地点都越来越难以完成实际的工作 (Every location has got worse for getting actual work done)
==========================================================================

远程办公 (Working from nowhere)
------------------------

![插图：一个人坐在弹跳的跳跳球上努力工作。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_WBD001.jpg)

如果你能完成工作，工作将会更好。在会议的间歇节奏、信息的不断累积或同事们匆匆而过的简单干扰中，集中注意力一直很困难。但自从新冠疫情爆发以来，每个工作场所都变得不太适合进行专注工作。

Work would be so much better if you could get work done. It has always been hard to focus amid the staccato rhythms of meetings, the relentless accumulation of messages or the simple distraction of colleagues thundering past. But since the covid-19 pandemic, every single place of work has become less conducive to concentration.

首先看看家里办公室。混合工作的好处在于你现在可以根据手头的任务选择工作地点。如果需要专注于工作，你现在可以跳过通勤时间，待在家里集中精力。这个策略在2019年可能效果不错，那时家里从来没有其他人。现在可能会有其他人在那里，争夺最佳的Wi-Fi位置，开心地吃掉你的午餐，大声地和自己的同事团队交谈。家已经变成一个共同办公的空间，但却没有任何共同的礼貌。

Start with the home office. The promise of hybrid working is that you can now choose your location depending on the task at hand. If you need to focus on work, you can now skip the commute, stay home and get your head down. This tactic would have worked well in 2019, when no one else was ever at home. Now there are likely to be other people there, too, grabbing the best spot for the Wi-Fi, merrily eating your lunch and talking loudly to a bunch of colleagues in their own workplaces. Home has become a co-working space but without any of the common courtesies.

即使家里没有家人或室友在家，他们现在也知道你可能在家。这意味着灾难。包裹会经常被送到；大部分时间都花在在自家门口被拍照，拿着有趣但不是给你的包裹。想要食物或钱的孩子知道该去哪里找到你。

Even if none of your family or flatmates is at home, they now know you might be. That spells disaster. Parcels are delivered with monotonous regularity; large chunks of the day are spent being photographed on your own doorstep holding intriguing packages that are not for you. Children who want food or money know where to track you down.

最糟糕的是，以前需要请假才能完成的工作现在可以在其他人在家的时候零成本完成。 “你今天去上班吗？”听起来可能像是一个无害的问题。但你应该引起高度警惕。这意味着一群人带着电钻会在你刚安静坐下来打开笔记本的时候闯入房子。

Worst of all, jobs that once required a day off can now be done at no personal cost by booking them in for days when someone else is at home. “Are you going in today?” might sound like an innocuous question. It should put you on high alert. It means that a bunch of people with drills will storm the house just as you settle down to the laptop.

一个自然的反应是去你想要避免的地方——办公室。但自疫情以来，办公室的作用已经发生了变化。它从来不是一个专心工作的好地方（封锁期间是个例外）。但现在，办公室变得更不适合了，因为现在办公室被看作是协作和建设企业文化的地方。

One natural response is to head to the place you were trying to avoid—the office. But its role has changed since the pandemic. It was never a great place for concentrating (the periods of lockdown were glorious exceptions). But it has become even less suitable now that the office is seen as the place where collaboration and culture-building happen.

以前你可能能够坐在与他人隔离的小隔间里；现在流行的是开放性，这意味着更少的隔断和更大的可视度。以前可能会有一个普通的椅子和一张桌子；现在你可能会被要求在香槟吧用高脚凳上摇晃。以前你可能会被打断；现在你得到了与人互动的机会。会议、头脑风暴、喝酒、吃饭、在跳跃着的跳跳球上来回弹跳或进行任何增进团队精神的可怕活动现在受到更多重视。而对专注工作的要求则少得多。

Before you might have been able to sit in a cubicle, fenced off from other people; now openness is in vogue, which means fewer partitions and greater visibility. Before you might have had a normal chair and a desk; now you will be asked to wobble awkwardly on a tall stool at a champagne bar. Before you were interrupted; now you are being given an opportunity to interact. There is much more emphasis on meetings, brainstorming, drinking, eating, bouncing around on space-hoppers or whatever appalling activity builds team spirit. There is much less emphasis on single-minded attention.

家里人满为患，办公室令人生畏。其他地方如共享办公空间和咖啡店呢？这些地方自疫情以来也变得更糟，原因有二。首先，这些地方的竞争更加激烈。所有找不到专注的人都纷纷想到去第三地点。

Home is heaving, the office is off-putting. What about other places, like co-working spaces and coffee shops? These too have got worse since the pandemic, for two reasons. First, there is more competition for spaces. Everyone else who is finding it hard to concentrate has had exactly the same idea of heading to a third location.

其次，在线会议使得到处联系每个人变得可以接受了。曾经说过你和老鼠之间永远不会相距超过六英尺；现在同样适用于Zoom视频通话。无论你在哪里——家里、办公室、咖啡馆、图书馆、修道院——总会有人在附近，唠叨着一些又枯燥又不容忽视的话题：缅因州地方报纸的困境，Solvency 2背后的风险计算或者为何Denise很难相处。

Second, online meetings have made it acceptable to reach everyone everywhere. It used to be said that you are never more than six feet away from a rat; now the same is true of a Zoom call. Wherever you are—homes, offices, cafés, libraries, monasteries—someone is within earshot, yapping away about something that manages to be both tedious and impossible to ignore: the plight of local papers in Maine, the risk calculations behind Solvency 2 or why Denise is so impossible to work with.

集中注意力问题有解决的办法。一个方法是变得更富裕：如果你有另一栋房子，或者说另一栋房子里还有一个翼，一切就会变得更轻松。另一个方法是故意逆潮流：如果周一大多数人都远程办公以专注工作，那么办公室在这一天会是一个更好的工作地方。最常见而不健康的答案是把专注的工作推迟到晚上和周末。

There are ways around the concentration problem. One is to become richer: everything is so much easier if you have another wing of the house, or indeed another house. Another is deliberately to swim against the hybrid tide: if Monday is the day when most people work from home in order to focus, the office is going to be a better place to work that day. The most common and least healthy answer is to defer focused work until the evenings and weekends.

这不是在为疫情前的世界发牢骚。每个地点作为专注工作的场所变得更糟，并不意味着整体情况变得更糟。混合工作允许人们选择特定任务最适合的工作地点。即使2020年之前的家里比以前嘈杂，偶尔呆在家里的选择对许多员工和雇主来说仍然比每天进入办公室更好。但无论你在哪里，其他人更有可能在场，或者更有与你互动的期待。专心工作的能力被作为灵活性的一个好处来推销。这可能是你为此付出的代价。■

This is not a lament for the pre-pandemic world. Just because each location has got worse as a place to do focused work does not mean that things have got worse overall. Hybrid work allows people to pick the most appropriate locations for specific tasks. The option of occasionally staying at home, even if home is noisier than it was before 2020, is still better for many workers and employers than the pre-covid norm of coming into the office every day. But wherever you are, other people are more likely to be there or to have a greater expectation of interacting with you. The ability to concentrate is sold as a benefit of flexibility. It can be the price you pay for it.■

为什么中国民族主义者开始抵制中国品牌? (Why are Chinese nationalists turning on Chinese brands?)
==========================================================================

显然，即使华为也不够爱国 (Even Huawei isn’t patriotic enough, apparently)
----------------------------------------------------------

![Bottles of Nongfu Spring drinking natural water.](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_WBP503.jpg)

**农夫山泉饮用天然水瓶装水瓶。**

EXCITABLE CHINESE netizens have long inveighed against foreign brands’ perceived insults of Chinese culture. Nike, an American shoemaker, was once attacked for depicting a man beating a dragon in a game of basketball. Marriott, an American hotel chain, was hit with an online campaign after it listed Taiwan and Tibet as countries. Dolce & Gabbana, an Italian fashion label, got an earful in 2018 over an ad that showed a Chinese model clumsily eating Italian food with chopsticks.

**令人兴奋的中国网民长期以来一直在抨击外国品牌对中国文化的 perceived 侮辱。美国鞋类制造商耐克曾因一则广告遭受抨击，广告中一名男子在篮球比赛中击败一只龙。美国酒店连锁品牌万豪在将台湾和西藏列为国家后遭受网上运动的打击。意大利时尚品牌杜嘉班纳在2018年推出一则广告，广告中一名中国模特笨拙地使用筷子吃意大利食物，引来一片批评。**

Now China’s online nationalists are taking aim at a new target. In the past two weeks they have besieged Nongfu, a bottler of spring water whose founder, Zhong Shanshan, is China’s richest man. Its sin? Typography. The Chinese character for tea used on Nongfu’s new beverage includes four brushstrokes resembling plus signs. To the online nationalists, the stylisation resembles the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, where Japanese generals who committed war crimes in China are commemorated.

**现在，中国的网上爱国者正将矛头对准了一个新的目标。过去两周，他们已经围攻了农夫山泉，这家瓶装泉水生产商的创始人钟睒睒是中国首富。它的罪过？字体排版。农夫山泉新饮料上使用的“茶”字在四笔中包含四个类似加号的笔画。在网上爱国者看来，这种风格酷似日本东京的靖国神社，那里供奉了在中国犯下战争罪行的日本将军。**

It takes a wild imagination to spot the likeness. But Nongfu’s critics are, it seems, a wildly imaginative bunch. They have unearthed other pro-Japanese symbolism. A mountain on its water bottles, one of China’s most recognisable logos, is Mount Fuji, supposedly. Set against a white backdrop, Nongfu’s red plastic bottle cap becomes, unmistakably, the Japanese flag. What is more, the name of Mr Zhong’s son, Zhong Shuzi, sure sounds Japanese (in a worse betrayal, he is an American citizen).

**发现这种相似性需要过分的想象力。但农夫山泉的批评者们似乎想象力丰富。他们还发掘出其他亲日象征。其中之一是农夫山泉水瓶上的一座山，这是中国最具辨识度的标志之一，据说是富士山。在白色背景下，农夫山泉的红色塑料瓶盖明显成了日本国旗。而钟声声的儿子钟术子的名字听起来确实像日本名字（更糟糕的是，他是美国公民）。**

A few local brands have been accused of mimicking Japanese style in the past. Miniso, a homeware retailer, was pilloried in 2022 for selling figurines in Chinese garb and labelling them as geishas. But the latest furore looks both more severe and broader. The Nongfu imaginings are already doing real damage. Daily sales of the spring water fell by more than 30% over the past fortnight. A few 7-Eleven convenience stores have vowed to stop carrying the products. The company’s market value is down by about 5% since the drama began, costing shareholders some $4bn.

**过去一些本地品牌曾被指责模仿日本风格。家居用品零售商名创优品在2022年因销售中国服饰的人偶并将其标签为艺伎而遭受抨击。但最新的风波看起来更为严重且更为广泛。农夫山泉的揣测已经带来了实质性的损害。过去两周瓶装水的日销量下降了超过30%。一些7-Eleven便利店立誓停止销售这些产品。公司市值自事件发生以来下跌约5%，使股东损失约40亿美元。**

And Nongfu is not the only firm in the nationalists’ sights. Li-Ning, a Nike rival known for tracksuits with “China” emblazoned in Chinese characters on the back, has drawn criticism over the supposed likeness between a new line of jackets and Japanese military uniforms from the second world war. One netizen wrote on Chinese social media that if he were caught wearing one, his grandfather would shoot him dead. Even Huawei, a technology giant that in the West is synonymous with Chinese patriotism and pride, has come under fire. Its transgression was to call its new homegrown semiconductors Kirin in English. The word is a Japanification of Qilin, the chips’ Chinese name, which refers to a mythical beast.

**农夫山泉并非唯一成为爱国者眼中的目标的公司。以中文背后印有“中国”字样而著称的耐克竞争对手李宁，因新款夹克与二战时期日本军服的相似之处而受到批评。一位网民在中国社交媒体上写道，如果被抓穿戴了此夹克，他的爷爷会开枪将他射死。就连华为，一家在西方被视为中国爱国主义和自豪的科技巨头也遭受了批评。其罪过在于将其新自主研发芯片以英文名称基林命名。这个词是基于芯片的中文名麒麟衍化而来，麒麟指一种神兽。**

State media have told the self-appointed culture police to calm down. One prominent nationalist, Hu Xijin, has called for an end to the madness. That only infuriated many of his erstwhile supporters, who turned on him instead and now call him a “traitorous running dog” on social sites. As Mr Hu is finding out the hard way, nationalism, both online and in the real world, is easier to whip up than it is to contain. ■

**官方媒体告诉这些自封的文化警察安静下来。一位知名民族主义者胡锡进呼吁结束这种疯狂。但这仅激怒了他的许多原来的支持者，他们反过来对他展开了攻击，如今在社交网站上称他为“卖国贼走狗”。如同胡锡进现在发现的那样，民族主义，无论是在网上还是现实世界中，更容易激起而难以遏制。**

埃隆·马斯克并非唯一将特拉华州视为目标 (Elon Musk is not alone in having Delaware in his sights)
==========================================================================

拉斯维加斯也是。 (Sin City does, too)

![插图展示了一个仙人掌、一个骰子、一张赌场筹码以及太阳试图拧开水龙头往装满水的桶里注水。同时一个小个子男人通过扩音器大喊](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_WBD000.jpg)

**在20世纪之交，美国注册企业的首选州是新泽西，那里是美国最大的信托组织之地，比如标准石油公司。其他州，包括它身旁的矮小邻居，都垂涎于企业注册带来的轻松赚钱的机会。当时，《美国法律评论》这本杂志写道：“羡慕着新泽西的蔬菜园工人、挖蛤蜊的人以及驱逐蚊虫的人挣得全国所有钱全进她的金库，受到烧灼的小德拉瓦决意要伸出那双小小的、圆圆的、娇嫩的小手，去抢夺甜蜜事物的袋子。”**

AT THE TURN of the 20th century the prime state to register businesses in America was New Jersey, home to America’s biggest trusts such as Standard Oil. Other states, including its diminutive next-door neighbour, coveted the spigot of easy money that came from business incorporation. “Little Delaware, gangrened with envy at the spectacle of the truck-patchers, clam-diggers and mosquito-wafters of New Jersey getting all the money in the country into her coffers, is determined to get her little tiny, sweet, round, baby hand into the grab-bag of sweet things,” the *American Law Review*, a journal, wrote at the time.

**它成功了。随着新泽西针对20世纪10年代的反托拉斯狂热收紧法律，企业们意识到德拉瓦州对他们更有吸引力。由此产生的企业迁徙将德拉瓦州变成了美国的注册之都。2022年，该州有190万家公司注册，几乎每个公民有两家公司。超过三分之二的《财富》500强企业按收入计算在该州注册（《经济学人》也有几家与之相关的实体）。在其最大城市威尔明顿，高楼林立，扮演着无面孔的企业所在地。2022年，企业税收和费用为该州带来约20亿美元，占其年度预算的很大一部分。**

It succeeded. As New Jersey tightened its laws in response to the antitrust fervour of the 1910s, businesses realised the grass was greener across the Delaware river. The resulting corporate migration has turned Delaware into America’s incorporation capital. In 2022, 1.9m firms were incorporated in the state, almost two for every one of its citizens. More than two-thirds of the *Fortune* 500 list of America’s biggest firms by revenue are registered there (as are a few entities linked to *The Economist*). In Wilmington, its biggest city, office towers stand as their faceless business domiciles. Business taxes and fees generated about $2bn for the state in 2022, a big part of its annual budget.

**因此毫不奇怪，如今其他州也急于通过提供更诱人的激励措施来抓住注册之机。一些受到伤害的大亨，比如特斯拉的头号喷子埃隆·马斯克，正在帮助为他们提出反德拉瓦州的案例。为评估它们的机会，专栏作家参观了内华达州，这个州一直希望把自己变得像对待婚姻那样友好地对待企业注册。拉斯维加斯内华达大学的法律教授本杰明·爱德华兹形容：“这里有令人郁闷的威明顿和德克萨斯的荒原。或者有着美妙的拉斯维加斯。”**

No surprise, then, that now other states are keen to get their own sweet, round mitts on the spigot by offering businesses even juicier incentives. Some aggrieved tycoons, such as X’s troll-in-chief, Elon Musk, are helping make the anti-Delaware case for them. To assess their chances, your columnist visited Nevada, which has long wanted to make itself as amenable to business registration as it is to nuptials. As Benjamin Edwards, a law professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, puts it: “There is dreary Wilmington and the Texas wastelands. Or there is fabulous Vegas.”

**拉斯维加斯的商事法庭与威明顿的商事法庭大相径庭。它们位于总法院，进入前会对你进行搜检。它们位于第16层，让你有一种高高在上的感觉。然而舒姆佩特尔听到的第一个案例却生活化，涉及租赁物业中的霉菌问题。该案的法官马克·登顿桌子上的一份文件提醒着这个州长期以来要被认真对待的问题。“将内华达州打造成为西部的司法德拉瓦州：如何修复内华达州的商业法庭”，这是2016年的一篇文章，指出了三个问题。商事法官不公开发表意见，这使得整个系统变得不可预测。他们强制处理商业和非商业案件，这导致速度很慢。内华达州有两个商业法庭区，拉斯维加斯和里诺，这意味着一些法律被不同解释。文章总结说，内华达州在挑战德拉瓦州之前有很多问题要解决。现在依然如此。**

Las Vegas’s business courts are a far cry from Wilmington’s Court of Chancery. They are in the general courthouse, so you are checked for weapons before you enter. Their location on the 16th floor provides a sense of being high above the hurly-burly. Yet the first case Schumpeter heard was down to earth, concerning mould in a rental property. A paper on the desk of Mark Denton, the judge in that case, is a reminder of the state’s long battle to be taken seriously. “Transforming Nevada into the judicial Delaware of the West: How to fix Nevada’s business courts”, from 2016, pointed to three problems. Business judges did not publish their opinions, which made the system unpredictable. They were forced to work on business and non-business cases, which made it slow. And Nevada had two business-court districts, Las Vegas and Reno, which meant some laws were interpreted differently. Nevada, the paper concluded, had a lot to fix before taking on Delaware. It still does.

**在威明顿，你不会找到这样的自我反省。当专栏作家上次访问时，那种自认为主导着全国公司法的权利感是明显的。他在威明顿俱乐部用餐，这里是供公司律师们吃饭、喝酒、讨论当天商业裁决的地方，必须系领带。翻阅最近从商业法庭传来的一些博学的裁决，夹杂着讨论“休克悖论”和莎士比亚，不难发现商法在威明顿的这些贵族地区就像老虎机在拉斯维加斯一样受推崇。德拉瓦州的卓越地位鲜少受到质疑。**

You do not find such soul-searching in Wilmington. When your columnist last visited, the sense of entitlement for setting the de facto corporate law of the land was palpable. He dined, with obligatory tie, at the Wilmington Club, a place for corporate lawyers to eat, drink and discuss the business rulings of the day over brandy and cigars. Read some of the erudite judgments that have emerged recently from the Court of Chancery, interspersed with discussion of the “soritical paradox” and Shakespeare, and they leave little doubt that business law is as prized in blue-blooded parts of Wilmington as slot machines are in red-blooded Vegas. Delaware’s pre-eminence is seldom questioned.

**但现在正是那些罕见时刻之一。一连串的裁决引起了不安。最著名的批评者是马斯克先生，他在一月份攻击了德拉瓦州，因为商事法庭取消了他作为特斯拉老板的560亿美元薪酬计划。作为回应，他将他的脑植入公司Neuralink重新注册在内华达州，并已申请将他的火箭公司SpaceX迁至德克萨斯州。由传媒大亨格雷格·马菲主持的在线旅行公司 TripAdvisor 正在转移到内华达州，理由是为了节省成本并避免“毫无根据的诉讼”，公司表示。一位商事法庭法官最近裁定，德拉瓦州无法阻止公司的搬迁，尽管他允许股东起诉寻求补偿。**

Now is one of those rare times. A flurry of rulings has been a cause for disquiet. The most prominent critic has been Mr Musk, who attacked Delaware in January after the Court of Chancery voided his $56bn pay package as boss of Tesla. In response, he reincorporated Neuralink, his brain-implant firm, in Nevada, and has filed to move SpaceX, his rocketry business, to Texas. TripAdvisor, an online travel firm chaired by Greg Maffei, a media baron, is decamping to Nevada—to save money and spare the board “unmeritorious litigation”, it says. A Court of Chancery judge recently ruled that Delaware could not stop the move, though he allowed shareholders to sue for compensation.

**德拉瓦州的辩护者本能地否定了批评。在本月在新奥尔良举办的图兰企业法研究会上，与会者指出，过去，德拉瓦州最吵闹的对手，比如出版商康拉德·布莱克，后来被判欺诈罪（布莱克勋爵在担任总统的唐纳德·特朗普任内被赦免）。然而，法律教授称最近的裁决——不仅是马斯克的案件，还包括德拉瓦州努力反对控股股东（比如私募基金）治理其上市子公司的协议——引发了对德拉瓦裁决的不可预测性的担忧。据说一些收购公司正在考虑转移到内华达州。**

Delaware’s defenders instinctively dismiss its critics. At a gathering this month at the Tulane Corporate Law Institute in New Orleans, panellists noted that in the past some of Delaware’s loudest antagonists, such as Conrad Black, a publisher, were later convicted of fraud (Lord Black was pardoned by Donald Trump when he was president). Yet law professors say recent rulings—not just Mr Musk’s case but also Delaware’s efforts to push back against agreements through which controlling stockholders, such as private-equity firms, govern their listed subsidiaries—have raised concerns about the unpredictability of Delaware judgments. Some buy-out firms are said to be thinking of moving to Nevada.

**内华达州州务卿弗朗西斯科·阿瓜拉强调了它的优势所在。内华达州倾向于支持控股股东在与少数投资者的“持续紧张关系”中，他说。他指出州议员对希望影响公司法规的企业主“可及”，这与德拉瓦州大不相同。但阿瓜拉也承认当地的缺点。内华达州较低的费用在一定程度上反映了服务欠佳。他表示，其商业登记系统长期以来一直处于“打补丁”的状态，目前正在进行1,500万美元的升级。面对这些限制，寻找德拉瓦州替代品的企业通常更倾向于怀俄明州或北达科他州。**

Francisco Aguilar, Nevada’s secretary of state, highlights its selling points. Nevada leans in favour of controlling shareholders in their “constant tension” with minority investors, he says. He points to the “accessibility” of state lawmakers to business-owners who want to influence corporate statutes—highly unDelaware-like behaviour. But Mr Aguilar also acknowledges local shortcomings. Nevada’s low fees partly reflect poor service. Its business-filing system has been “duct-taped together” for too long, he says, and is in the midst of a $15m upgrade. Faced with such constraints, firms looking for an alternative to Delaware have often preferred Wyoming or North Dakota, he admits.

**如果内华达州为了吸引企业而提供宽松的股东保护，那么投资者可能会认为搬迁到那里的公司价值更低。这意味着对于德拉瓦州目前来说，它对内华达或其他任何州都没什么可担心的。但竞争仍有可能是有益的，即使包括提供更松散公司标准的竞争者，也会让德拉瓦州保持警惕。甚至可能使这个第一州变得不那么令人难以忍受地自鸣得意。■**

If Nevada offers loose shareholder protections in order to woo businesses, the danger is that investors will value firms that move there less highly. This means that Delaware has little to fear from Nevada—or any other state—for the time being. But the competition could still turn out to be healthy, even if it involves rivals offering laxer corporate standards, by keeping Delaware on its toes. It may even make the First State less insufferably smug. ■

卡车可以更快地实现绿色化吗？ (Can lorries go green faster?)
==========================================

通往零排放商用车辆的漫漫长路 (The long road to zero-emission commercial vehicles)
----------------------------------------------------------------

![电动卡车司机使用为零排放卡车保留的车道。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_WBP001.jpg)

**你可能会认为，如果你花了10万美元购买一辆车，你会收到一辆豪华车——比如保时捷。**实际上，许多这样的购买者更在意汽车的载重量，而不是标志。因为这也是大型卡车的价格。

YOU MAY think that if you splashed out $100,000 for a vehicle you would take delivery of something flash—a Porsche, say. In fact, many such buyers care less about the badge on the bonnet and more about how much load the thing can carry. For this is also the price of a large lorry.

像卡车和货车这样的商用车辆保持着供应链的畅通和交付的继续。它们也为制造商带来了大量利润。2023年，货车在Stellantis的销售额（该公司的最大股东Exor公司是《经济学人》的母公司之一）中占到1900亿欧元（2070亿美元）的三分之一。全球最大型和大型卡车制造商Daimler Truck去年的营收达到560亿欧元。美国汽车巨头福特的商用部门Ford Pro在销售140万辆车辆的基础上净利润达72亿美元，而其车辆销量翻了一番的车辆部门Ford Blue的盈利是75亿美元。沃尔沃和戴姆勒制造的卡车拉来的利润水平与高端汽车制造商相当。

Commercial vehicles such as lorries and vans keep supply chains humming and deliveries moving. They also make lots of money for their makers. In 2023 vans accounted for a third of the €190bn ($207bn) in sales at Stellantis (whose largest shareholder, Exor, part-owns *The Economist*’s parent company). Daimler Truck, the world’s biggest manufacturer of medium-sized and large lorries, earned revenues of €56bn last year. Ford Pro, the American car giant’s commercial arm, made a net profit of $7.2bn on sales of 1.4m units, compared with $7.5bn at Ford Blue, its car division, which sold twice as many vehicles. Lorries made by Volvo and Daimler rake in margins typical of an upmarket carmaker.

考虑到已经高昂的前期成本和购买者对运营费用的关注，你可能会期望商用车辆快速转向**电动化**，尤其是因为它们也是碳排放的重要来源（在欧盟的道路上，卡车和公共汽车排放的碳占了四分之一以上）。商业购买者更看重这种总拥有成本，而不是个别司机可能会愿意支付溢价来安慰他们的环保良心。然而，令人失望的是，对许多企业来说，计算依然有利于汽油和柴油。这种情况能改变吗？

Given both the already high upfront cost and the attention buyers pay to operating expenses, you might expect commercial vehicles to go electric fast—not least because they are also disproportionately heavy emitters (lorries and buses spew over a quarter of the carbon on EU roads). Business buyers value this total cost of ownership more than individual motorists, who may pay a premium to salve their climate conscience. Alas, for many businesses the calculation continues to favour petrol and diesel. Can that change?

即使在2023年占全球重型电动卡车销量85%的中国，仅有25辆卡车中有一辆是环保型，而新车中每三辆中就有一辆是环保型汽车。在欧洲，卡车中每70辆中有一辆是环保型，而乘用车中每七辆中就有一辆是环保型。据bcg咨询公司称，当欧盟在2035年开始禁止销售内燃机车辆时，预计只有四分之三的卡车可能会是电动车。另一家咨询公司idTechEx预测，到2030年，零排放卡车在美国销量将占13%，远低于美国总统乔·拜登提出的汽车销量50%的目标。

Even in [China](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/11/an-influx-of-chinese-cars-is-terrifying-the-west), which in 2023 accounted for 85% of global sales of heavy-duty e-lorries (the largest sort), just one in 25 such vehicles was green, compared with one in three new passenger cars. In Europe the figure is one in 70, and one in seven for passenger cars. When an eu ban on sale of cars with internal combustion engines comes into force in 2035 only three-quarters of lorries may be electric, according to bcg, a consultancy. idTechEx, another consultancy, forecasts that zero-emission lorries will make up 13% of sales in America by 2030, far short of President Joe Biden’s goal for 50% of car sales.

在未来六年内，电气化最有可能首先在运行路线较短的小型车辆上实现，比如即时配送服务，这是Arthur D. Little咨询公司的亚历山大·克鲁格的观点。小型电动货车的经济效益看起来很吸引人。电池可以更小，车辆可以在夜间在停车场充电。在一天中行驶相对短的距离但一年里里程数很高的电动货车，据麦肯锡咨询公司的顾问估算，可能比传统货车有10%的成本优势。Stellantis的Uwe Hochgeschurtz指出，**转向电动**也能应对城市愈发严格的排放规定。沃尔沃技术主管拉斯·斯坦克维斯特认为欧洲的城市完全可以使用电动环卫车。

In the next six years electrification is likeliest for smaller vehicles operating over shorter routes, such as last-mile delivery services, thinks Alexander Krug of Arthur D. Little, one more consulting firm. The economics of small e-vans look compelling. Batteries can be smaller and vehicles can be recharged overnight at depots. Electric vans that travel relatively short distances in a day but cover lots of miles in a year could have a 10% cost advantage over conventional ones, calculate consultants at McKinsey. Uwe Hochgeschurtz of Stellantis notes that going electric can also insure against ever tougher emissions rules in cities. Lars Stenqvist, Volvo’s technology chief, sees no reason why cities in Europe should not run electric bin lorries.

即使电动车辆目前还不太便宜，让像联邦快递和DHL这样的交付公司助力其服务的商家达成减排承诺是有好处的，而这也是许多购物者要求的。联邦快递已将到2025年其一半包裹送送车辆**电动化**的目标。DHL希望到2030年将其六成货车送送车辆**电动化**。亚马逊在美国道路上有1万辆电动货车，希望到2030年有10万辆。

Even if they are not yet cheaper, going electric allows delivery firms such as FedEx and DHL to help merchants they serve meet carbon-cutting pledges which many shoppers demand. FedEx has set a target for half its parcel-delivery vehicles to be electric by 2025. dhl wants the same for 60% of its last-mile vehicles by 2030. Amazon has 10,000 electric vans on American roads and hopes to have 100,000 by 2030.

重型车辆的经济状况则更为严峻。乐观主义者指出，许多路线完全适合当前电动卡车的续航能力。美国交通部据此认为，去年在美国，四分之三的货物运输路线的行驶距离都不到250英里（400公里）。沃尔沃计算称，欧洲45%的货物行驶路线都不足300公里。意大利卡车制造商Iveco的技术主管马可·利卡多预计，未来几年内，在物流枢纽之间长达200公里的运输路线上，电动卡车将实现与传统卡车的总成本平价。

The economics are a heavier lift for heavy-duty vehicles. Optimists note that plenty of routes are well within current e-lorries’ range. America’s Department of Transportation reckons that last year the distance travelled by three-quarters of all goods ferried by road in the country was less than 250 miles (400km). Volvo calculates that 45% of goods in Europe travel less than 300km. Marco Liccardo, head of technology at Iveco, an Italian lorrymaker (also part-owned by Exor), expects electric lorries to reach total-cost parity with conventional lorries in 200km runs between logistics hubs in a couple of years.

监管机构试图加快推进电动化。在美国，他们提议到2032年要求一半新巴士销售额和四分之一新重型卡车销售额全电动化。购买这类清洁车辆的人也可以获得税收抵免。欧盟要求到2025年，汽车制造商车队的平均排放量要比2019年降低15%，到2030年降低43%。

Regulators are trying to speed things along. In America they have proposed requiring that half of sales of new buses and a quarter of new heavy-duty lorries be all-electric by 2032. Buyers of such clean vehicles can also count on tax credits. The eu is requiring cuts of 15% to the average emissions of carmakers’ fleets by 2025 from their level in 2019, and of 43% by 2030.

到目前为止，这些规定的影响还很有限。仅有少数电动车型上市销售。它们所需的巨大笨重电池会推高购买成本。电动卡车让企业付出的费用是柴油车的两到三倍，且续航里程也有限。2023年全球销售了约200万辆的最大卡车中，最难转向电动化。沃尔沃去年售出6000辆电动卡车，仅占其总销量的2%。

So far this is having little effect. Only a few electric models are on sale. The large and bulky batteries they require drive up the purchase cost. Electric trucks set businesses back between two and three times as much as a diesel one does, and have limited range. The largest trucks, of which 2m or so were sold worldwide in 2023, are the hardest to wean off internal combustion. Volvo shifted 6,000 electric ones last year, just 2% of its total sales.

即使成本劣势可以克服，基础设施问题仍然存在。小型车队可以在夜间在停车场充电，而短途路线上的卡车可以在装卸货物时在两端充电。然而，更远的路线将需要公共充电站。为卡车专门设计的快速充电器需要比为汽车提供的充电器消耗更多的电力，同时需要更多的停车空间。能够在几分钟内给汽车充电的最快充电器，对于卡车则需要大约90分钟。

Even if the cost disadvantage can be overcome, that leaves the problem of infrastructure. Van fleets can recharge overnight at depots and lorries on shorter routes can be charged at either end, while they are loaded or unloaded. However, longer routes will require public charging stations. And dedicated fast chargers for lorries need far more power than for cars, plus lots of parking space. The fastest chargers that top up cars in a few minutes would take around 90 minutes for a lorry.

德国和荷兰目前已经投入运营一些“兆瓦级快充电器”，速度是传统充电器的10倍。然而，欧洲范围内的充电网络需要高达360亿欧元的投资，据咨询公司PwC估算。为卡车提供氢燃料充电站——电池的零排放替代品，也不便宜。资金吃紧的政府不太可能掏出这笔费用。拜登政府于3月12日发布了一项战略，为卡车建设公共充电站。但即使计划有效，也不会立竿见影。

A few “megawatt chargers”, which are ten times faster, are in operation in Germany and the Netherlands. But a Europe-wide charging network requires investments of up to €36bn, estimates PwC, a consultancy. One to refuel lorries with hydrogen—a zero-emissions alternative to batteries—would not be cheap either. Cash-strapped governments are unlikely to want to foot the bill. On March 12th the Biden administration unveiled a strategy to build public charging for lorries. But even if the plan works, it will not happen overnight.

车辆制造商本身也是另一个问题。快速转向全电动世界会“削弱七八年的利润”，瑞典商用车初创公司Einride的老板罗伯特·福尔克表示。遗留汽车制造商被特斯拉和中国廉价但性能不错的车型逼着首先走向电气化，但卡车行业承受的干扰较小。特斯拉在2017年推出了其电动卡车Semi，但直到2022年底才开始交付，并在路上拥有大约100辆电动卡车。其计划在2024年年底之前每年生产5万辆看起来是过于乐观了。尼古拉在2014年隆重推出，2019年与Iveco达成合资协议开发零排放卡车，但却遇到困难。其创始人于2023年因误导投资者入狱。公司市值从2020年的290亿美元跌至约9亿美元。去年，其与Iveco的合资项目解散，仅售出35辆氢燃料电池车辆。现已暂停生产电池车辆。

Vehicle makers themselves are another problem. Moving swiftly to an all-electric world would “write off seven or eight years of profit”, says Robert Falck, boss of Einride, a Swedish commercial-vehicle startup. Whereas legacy carmakers were forced into electrification first by Tesla and then by cheap but decent Chinese models, the lorry business has faced less disruption. Tesla unveiled the Semi, its electric lorry, in 2017 but started shipping it only in late 2022 and has a fleet of around 100 on the road. Its plans to produce 50,000 a year by the end of 2024 look wildly optimistic. Nikola, which launched to great fanfare in 2014 and in 2019 struck a joint venture with Iveco to develop zero-emission lorries, has struggled. Its founder was jailed in 2023 for misleading investors. Its market value has crashed from $29bn in 2020 to around $900m. Last year its joint venture with Iveco was disbanded and it sold just 35 hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles. It has paused production of its battery lorries.

着眼于即时配送货车的初创公司的命运也是参差不齐。加快生产并吸引资金正在变得困难。美国公司Lordstown和瑞典的Volta Trucks已经破产。英国公司Arrival尽管收到了1万辆面向联邦快递和DHL竞争对手的vans订单，但仍面临破产的风险。Rivian在2019年签署了一份协议，向亚马逊销售10万辆货车，而Canoo则在于沃尔玛等公司建立了合作关系，但两家公司都在努力规模化生产汽车并消耗现金。其他制造商，比如在英国制造电池动力货车和卡车的REE和Tevva，或制造中型卡车的Harbinger和Workhorse在希望中前行，但还有很长的路要走。

Startups eyeing last-mile delivery vans have had similarly mixed fortunes. Ramping up production and raising capital is proving tough. Lordstown, an American firm, and Volta Trucks of Sweden have gone bust. Arrival, a British one, is teetering on the brink, despite an order of 10,000 vans from ups, a rival of FedEx and DHL. Rivian, which in 2019 signed a deal to sell 100,000 vans to Amazon, and Canoo, which counts Walmart among its customers, are struggling to make vehicles at scale and are burning cash. Other manufacturers, such as REE and Tevva, which make battery-powered vans and lorries in Britain, or Harbinger and Workhorse, which make medium-sized trucks in America, are hopeful but have even further to go.

来自中国对遗留卡车制造商的威胁也没有在乘用车市场那样严峻。与电动汽车市场一样，由于具有世界领先的电池行业（和强大的政府激励措施），中国在商用电动车方面领先于其他国家。英国品牌Maxus被中国汽车制造商上汽收购，正在欧洲各地销售货车；其中一款车型在12月份是英国最畅销的电动货车。中国最大的电动汽车公司比亚迪已将一些大型电池动力卡车出口到美国。

The threat to legacy lorrymakers from China is also far less acute than in the market for passenger cars. As with electric cars, China has stolen a march on everyone else in commercial EVs, thanks to its world-beating battery industry (and strong government incentives). Maxus, a British brand acquired by saic, a Chinese carmaker, is selling vans across Europe; one model was Britain’s best-selling electric van in December. byd, China’s biggest electric-car company, has exported a handful of large battery-powered lorries to America.

然而，中国的卡车制造商在海外市场的生存环境甚至比其汽车制造商更为恶劣，后者受到许多西方政府的怀疑。一位汽车执行官称欧洲对卡车的严格法规“相当于关税”，并补充称这使得中国商用电动车在欧洲市场上难以竞争。

But China’s lorrymakers will find life harder in foreign markets even than its carmakers, which are viewed with suspicion by many Western governments. One car executive calls Europe’s strict regulations for lorries “the equivalent of tariffs”, adding that this makes Chinese commercial EVs uncompetitive on the continent.

福尔克先生希望通过一种新的商业模式“货运的优步”来撼动市场。沃尔沃和Iveco正试图通过一项融资交易增加其电动卡车的吸引力，该融资交易避开了高昂的前期成本，而是让客户按使用费用支付。Einride更进一步，拥有由合作伙伴建造和由投资者资助的车队，并将货物运输作为一种服务提供。公司已经为大型船公司Maersk、酿酒商ab InBev和超市连锁店Lidl运作车队。这是一条走向电动货运的有趣途径。但这条路也看起来漫长而曲折。■

Mr Falck hopes to shake up the market with a new business model, which he calls “Uber for freight”. Volvo and Iveco are trying to increase the appeal of their electric lorries with a financing deal that sidesteps high upfront costs in favour of customers paying by use. Einride goes a step further, owning its own fleet of vehicles (built by partners and financed by investors) and providing the lugging of goods as a service. The company already operates fleets for Maersk, a shipping giant, ab InBev, a brewer, and Lidl, a supermarket chain. That is an interesting path to electric freight. But it, too, looks long and winding. ■

年轻男女间渐行渐远 (Why young men and women are drifting apart)
===================================================

不同世界观或影响政治、家庭等 (Diverging worldviews could affect politics, families and more)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

![An illustration depicting a young woman and a young man leaning against opposite sides of a brick wall](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_IRD001.jpg)

在波兰首都华沙的一家时尚食品市场，两名女工程师正在讨论遇到善良、开明男士有多难。几年前，保利娜·纳西洛夫斯卡得到了大幅加薪。她的男友问道：“你是不是和你上司有染？”如今他已经成为前男友。

In a trendy food market in Warsaw, Poland’s capital, two female engineers are discussing how hard it is to meet a nice, enlightened man. Paulina Nasilowska got a big pay rise a few years ago. Her boyfriend asked: “Did you have an affair with your boss?” He is now an ex-boyfriend.

纳西洛夫斯卡的朋友乔安娜·瓦尔查克回忆起她在Tinder上认识的一个男士，他透露自己是一个“红色药丸”（red-pill）男人（这是对电影《黑客帝国》中“醒悟药丸”的参考，意味着看清现实的人。在“男权主义者领域”，这个名词指的是意识到男性受到压迫。）他认为家务和育儿是女人的工作，认为女性不能成为领导。他们没有进行第二次约会。

Ms Nasilowska’s friend, Joanna Walczak, recalls a man she met on Tinder who revealed that he was a “red-pill” guy (a reference to “The Matrix”, a film, meaning someone who sees reality clearly. In the “manosphere”, a global online community of angry men, it means realising that men are oppressed.) He thought household chores and child care were women’s work, and that women could not be leaders. They didn’t have a second date.

通常情况下，像纳西洛夫斯卡和瓦尔查克这样年轻的波兰女性支持自由派左翼政党，这些政党认真对待女性问题，并承诺合法化堕胎。她们抱怨，年轻的波兰男性更倾向于右翼，甚至极右翼。回想去年的选举。那时，18至29岁男性的首选是联盟党，该党宣扬自由市场经济和传统社会价值观（“反对女权主义。捍卫真正的女性”是其口号之一）。26%的年轻男性支持该党；而他们的女性同龄人仅有6%支持。

Typically for young Polish women, Ms Nasilowska and Ms Walczak support parties of the liberal left, which take women’s issues seriously and promise to legalise abortion. Young Polish men, they complain, hew more to the right, or even to the far right. Consider last year’s election. Then the top choice for 18- to 29-year-old men was Confederation, a party that touts free-market economics and traditional social values. (“Against feminists. In defence of real women” is one of its slogans.) Some 26% of young men backed it; only 6% of their female peers did.

年轻的波兰男性有他们自己的抱怨。两位来自一个小镇的二十多岁消防员表示，女性主义走得太远。鲁卡希说，他过去可以参加乡村舞会，“那里的女人都适合做妻子。”现在，“她们都在社交媒体上发布厚颜无耻的照片，”他感叹道。马特乌什抱怨说，媒体“都持有偏见，推动着文化向左转”，（两位男士都没有透露姓名）。人们不再承认男性和女性通常希望从事不同类型的工作。

Young Polish men have their own set of complaints. Feminism has gone too far, say two firemen in their 20s in a small town. Lukasz says he used to be able to go to a village dance party and “the women there were wife material.” Nowadays “they’re all posting shameless pictures of themselves on social media,” he laments. The media are “all biased and pushing the culture to the left”, complains Mateusz (neither man would give a surname). People no longer admit that men and women often want to do different kinds of work.

在发达世界许多地方，年轻男性和女性的态度正在两极化。《经济学人》使用欧洲社会调查、美国普遍社会调查和韩国社会调查的民意调查数据，分析了来自20个富裕国家的数据。20年前，18至29岁男性和女性在一个从非常自由到非常保守的自我报告尺度上没有太大差异。但我们的分析发现，到2020年，这一差距为0.75（见图表1）。作为对比，这个差距大致是同一年具有学位和没有学位的人之间观点差异的两倍。

In much of the developed world, the attitudes of young men and women are polarising. *The Economist* analysed polling data from 20 rich countries, using the European Social Survey, America’s General Social Survey and the Korean Social Survey. Two decades ago there was little difference between men and women aged 18-29 on a self-reported scale of 1-10 from very liberal to very conservative. But our analysis found that by 2020 the gap was 0.75 (see chart 1 ). For context, this is roughly twice the size of the gap in opinion between people with and without a degree in the same year.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_EPC744.png)

换个角度看，到2020年，年轻男性描述自己为自由派的可能性只略高于保守派，两者之间仅有2个百分点的差距。然而，年轻女性更倾向于左派而不是右派，差距高达27个百分点。

Put another way, in 2020 young men were only slightly more likely to describe themselves as liberal than conservative, with a gap of just two percentage points. Young women, however, were much more likely to lean to the left than the right, with a gap of a massive 27 percentage points.

在我们研究的所有大国中，年轻男性比年轻女性更保守（见图表2）。在波兰，1-10分尺度上的差距为1.1分。在美国，这个差距为1.4，在法国是1，在意大利是0.75，在英国是0.71，在韩国是0.74。男性和女性一直以来都对世界有着不同看法。但令人注目的是，一种政治意见上的鸿沟正在拉大，因为年轻女性变得更加自由主义，而他们的男性同龄人却不是。

In all the large countries we examined, young men were more conservative than young women (see chart 2). In Poland the gap was 1.1 points on a scale of 1-10. It was a hefty 1.4 in America, 1 in France, 0.75 in Italy, 0.71 in Britain and 0.74 in South Korea. Men and women have always seen the world differently. What is striking, though, is that a gulf in political opinions has opened up, as younger women are becoming sharply more liberal while their male peers are not.

对于年轻女性来说，前几代女性主义者所取得的胜利，大大增加了女性在职场和公共生活中的机会，已成为过去。她们关注持续存在的不公正问题，从男性暴力到苛刻的堕胎法律（某些国家存在），再到女性承担不成比例的家务和育儿责任。许多男性在某种程度上支持她们。但也有相当一部分人公开反对。年轻女性的热衷自由主义可能源于一种感觉，即还有许多工作需要完成，而且反对力量将会很大。

For young women, the triumphs of previous generations of feminists, in vastly increasing women’s opportunities in the workplace and public life, are in the past. They are concerned with continuing injustices, from male violence to draconian abortion laws (in some countries) and gaps in pay to women shouldering a disproportionate share of housework and child care. Plenty of men are broadly in their corner. But a substantial portion are vocally not. Young women’s avid liberalism may spring from a feeling that there is much work still to be done, and that opposition to doing it will be stiff.

**约会场景对没有上大学的男性来说也可能是黯淡的。** 追求上升通道的女性拒绝他们。年轻的波兰乳品农民Michal Pazura暂停为拖拉机轮胎充气，回想起一个“不喜欢农场气味”的女朋友，她离开他去住在城里。“我想要传统的，稳定的生活方式。她追求快乐。” 农民男性在寻找配偶方面如此困难，以至于名为“农民想娶妻”的真人秀是波兰电视上最受欢迎的节目之一。波兰消防员Lukasz表示：“很难说如今年轻女性在男性身上看中什么。” 他回忆道，以前她们只想要一个“收入稳定、能修理家里东西……拥有驾照”的男性。

The gap does not translate straightforwardly into voting patterns, but it is visible. One poll found that 72% of young American women who voted in House elections in 2022 backed the Democratic candidate; some 54% of young men did. In 2008 there was barely any gap. In Europe, where many elections offer a wide array of parties, young women are more likely to support the most left-wing ones, whereas young men are more likely to favour the right or even the radical right.

**态度上的分歧会影响今天的年轻人最终结婚生子吗？** 现在还为时过早。但对于那些认为富裕世界日益下降的出生率是个问题的人来说，早期迹象是令人沮丧的。在美国，美国生活调查中心的Daniel Cox、Kelsey Eyre Hammond和Kyle Gray发现，Z世代（通常定义为出生在1990年代末至2000年代初之间的人）的第一段浪漫恋情开始的时间比千禧一代（出生在1980年至1990年代末）或X一代（出生在1980年前后的十年内）要晚，并且更容易感到孤独。此外，与更年长的女性不同，Z世代女性比她们的男性同龄人更有可能自称为**LGBT**（31%比16%）。尚不清楚这种不匹配是否会持续，如果持续下去，将如何影响未来家庭的形成。

In France in 2022 young men were much keener than young women on Eric Zemmour, a presidential candidate who wrote a book rebutting Simone de Beauvoir, France’s best-known feminist. Germany’s election in 2021 saw the largest ever left-right gap between the votes of young women and men, according to Ansgar Hudde of the University of Cologne. In Portugal, where the far-right Chega party surged in an election on March 10th, support for it is concentrated among voters who are young, male and less educated. And South Korea in 2022 elected an overtly anti-feminist president; more than 58% of men in their 20s voted for him. Some 58% of women in their 20s backed his rival.

**对于反对女权主义的抵制可能特别在年轻男性中尤为强烈**，因为他们是最感到受到女性进步威胁的人。对女性的更好工作不一定意味着男性的工作更糟糕，但许多男性认为是这样的。年长男性不太困扰，因为他们更有可能在事业上或退休中立定脚跟。相比之下，年轻男性刚刚起步，所以“最可能认为女性的竞争对于他们未来人生道路是个潜在威胁”，Off博士、Charron博士和Alexander博士提到。在一项最近的研究中，他们发现，如果他们所在地区的失业率最近上升，并且觉得他们所在社会的制度不公平，那么年轻的欧洲男性尤其容易对女性感到不满意（并认为女权主义走得太远）。他们补充说，反女权主义观点往往会成为右翼威权主义观点的一个良好预测因素。

The attitude gap between the sexes is also visible in how they view each other. People in 27 European countries were asked whether they agreed that “advancing women’s and girls’ rights has gone too far because it threatens men’s and boys’ opportunities.” Unsurprisingly, men were more likely to concur than women. Notably, though, young men were more anti-feminist than older men, contradicting the popular notion that each generation is more liberal than the previous one. Gefjon Off, Nicholas Charron and Amy Alexander of Gothenburg University use a Dutch analogy to illustrate the difference between young (18-29) and old (65+) European men. It is as great, on this question, as the gap between the average supporter of Geert Wilders’s radical-right Party for Freedom and the Liberal Democrats.

**并非所有男性的抱怨都是毫无根据的。** 在一些国家，离婚法院倾向于在子女抚养纠纷中偏袒母亲。在其他国家，养老金规定存在偏差。男性较早进入劳动力市场，寿命较短，但富裕国家的女性退休年龄平均略低。在波兰，退休年龄比男性低五年，因此波兰男性可以期待在退休后工作的时间是他们生活时间的三倍，而对于波兰女性，这一比例是1.4，Bocconi大学的Michał Gulczyński指出。这被许多男性认为是不公平的。波兰消防员Mateusz回忆起一个左翼立法者被问到，如果她对平等权利如此热衷，那么平等化养老金年龄怎么样？“她改变了话题，”他讥讽道。

A similar pattern holds in other advanced countries. Although a higher share of young British men think it is harder to be a woman than a man than think the opposite (35% to 26%), they are likelier than old British men to say it is harder to be a man than a woman. Young British women are more likely than their mothers to believe the opposite. Nearly 80% of South Korean men in their 20s say that men are discriminated against. Barely 30% of men over 60 agree, making their views indistinguishable from those of women in their 20s or 60s.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_EPC748.png)

**尤其影响年轻男性的另一个因素是服兵役。** 他们是首批被征召的；而女性通常豁免。在韩国，男性普遍服兵役，而且以艰苦著称，这助长了男性的怨恨。在欧洲，征兵已不再普遍，但是俄罗斯对乌克兰的入侵使得邻国的年轻男性，比如波兰，更担心可能被征召，Gulczyński先生表示。

In China pollsters do not ask about voting intentions, but they find a similar divergence between young men and women when it comes to gender roles (see chart 3). Yue Qian of the University of British Columbia and Jiaxing Li of the Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences looked at survey data for 35,000 Chinese people. In their analysis they found that young men were much more likely than young women to agree with statements such as “men should put career first, whereas women should put family first” and “when the economy is bad, female employees should be fired first.”

**社交媒体是年轻人越来越多地视野世界的透镜，** 可能加剧了两极化。首先，它们让人们形成信息茧房。当一个群体中有着相同看法的人讨论一个问题时，他们往往会变得更极端，因为个人竞相重申群体的核心立场，并谴责那些质疑的人。

Young Chinese men’s views were not much different from those of older men, whereas young women’s views were far more egalitarian than their mothers’. Claire, a market researcher in Beijing (who uses an English name to preserve her anonymity), says she wants a partner who will treat her as an equal and share the housework. “I think most Chinese men would fail that test,” she sighs. Dr Qian notes that when Chinese parents go to “matchmaking corners” in parks, they brag about their sons’ jobs and degrees, but hide their daughters’ achievements, fearing they will put off potential suitors.

**当一群受挫的年轻男性在网上聚集时，对话往往沦为厌恶女性。** 在以男性为主的中国聊天室经常出现“女权主义婊子”的短语，还有一个将“拳”的字音插入“女权主义”中使其听起来更具侵略性的双关语。

What is going on? The most likely causes of this growing division are education (young men are getting less of it than young women), experience (advanced countries have become less sexist, and men and women experience this differently) and echo chambers (social media aggravate polarisation). Also, in democracies, many politicians on the right are deftly stoking young male grievances, while many on the left barely acknowledge that young men have real problems.

**一旦一个男性加入了愤怒的在线群体，要留在其中的压力就会很大。** 华盛顿特区的一位学生Benjamin说，他曾是一个“红丸（红丸代表接受一系列矫枉过正观点的人）……做清洁工，吃麦当劳，陷入自我怜悯中”。他会在线观看关于如何增强自信和追求女性的课程。当他退出男性圈时，他的朋友嘲笑他是“蓝丸（蓝丸代表被社会牵制的人）”或“角质（一个软弱的男性）”。

But they do, starting with education. Although the men at the top are doing fine, many of the rest are struggling. In rich countries, 28% of boys but only 18% of girls fail to reach the minimum level of reading proficiency as defined by PISA, which tests high-school students. And women have overtaken men at university (see chart 4). In the EU, the share of men aged 25 to 34 with tertiary degrees rose from 21% to 35% between 2002 and 2020. For women it rose faster, from 25% to 46%. In America, the gap is about the same: ten percentage points more young women than men earn a bachelor’s degree.

**其次，算法用引人恐慌或愤怒的内容吸引用户，使世界看起来比实际更加恐怖和不公正。** 点击“#MeToo”故事的女性将看到更多类似的内容；点击男性被误指控强奸的故事的男性也会看到类似内容。每个人可能对自己面临的风险有夸大的认识。

Differences in education lead to differences in attitude: people who attend college are more likely to absorb a liberal, egalitarian outlook. The education gap also leads to differences in how men and women experience life, work and romance. To simplify: when a woman leaves university in a rich country, she is likely to find a white-collar job and be able to support herself. But when she enters the dating market (assuming she is heterosexual), she finds that, because there are many more female graduates than male ones, the supply of liberal, educated men does not match demand. Charelle Lewis, a 26-year-old health-care worker in Washington, DC, complains that men her age have “a little-boy mindset”.

“当你去健身房锻炼，视线中有一个女性，突然间你因性骚扰而在TikTok上成名，” 亚特兰大的28岁保守男性Kahlil Rose说。他认识的人都没有发生这种事。但是他在手机上看到过，所以这在他的意识中占据重要地位。华盛顿的学生Benjamin也给出了一个类似的悲观视角：“我这个年龄的男性害怕结婚，因为他们听到了一个警世故事：女人出轨，提出离婚，拿走他所有的努力。”

The dating scene can also be bleak for men who did not go to university. Upwardly mobile women reject them. Michal Pazura, a young Polish dairy farmer, takes a break from inflating tractor tyres and recalls a girlfriend who “didn’t like the smell” of the farm and left him to live in a town. “I wanted a traditional, stable lifestyle. She wanted fun.” Male farmers have such a hard time finding spouses that a reality show called “Farmer Wants a Wife” is one of the most popular on Polish television. “It’s hard to say what young women want in a man these days,” says Lukasz, the Polish fireman. Previously, they just wanted a man with “a stable income, who could fix things in the house…and who had a driving licence”, he recalls.

**女性在网上看到一个不同的世界。** 华沙的大学生Julia Kozik遵循她在TikTok上看到的一条建议。当她搭乘出租车时，她会折下一缕头发放在座位下，以防被绑架，警方需要DNA证据。“我尽量避免接触男性，”她说。

Will the gulf in attitudes affect how many of today’s young people eventually couple up and have kids? It is too soon to know. But for those who think the rich world’s tumbling birth rates are a problem, the early signs are discouraging. In America, Daniel Cox, Kelsey Eyre Hammond and Kyle Gray of the Survey Centre on American Life find that Generation Z (typically defined as those born between the late 1990s and early 2000s) have their first romantic relationship years later than did Millennials (born between 1980 and the late 1990s) or Generation X (born in the decade or so to 1980), and are more likely to feel lonely. Also, Gen Z women, unlike older women, are dramatically more likely than their male peers to describe themselves as LGBT (31% to 16%). It remains to be seen whether this mismatch will last, and if so, how it will affect the formation of families in the future.

**政治左派一直在努力说服女性他们关心她们的问题。** 但他们没有想出如何与男性交流，自由派学者Richard Reeves在《男孩和男人》中提出。进步人士经常假设“性别不平等只可能对女性不利”。并且过分地使用“有毒的男性”这样的标签，以至于暗示男性本质上有问题。与其吸引不成熟的男孩和男人对其行为进行对话，不如“更可能将他们送往在线男性圈，那里他们会被安慰他们没做错任何事，自由派人士正在排挤他们”。

The backlash against feminism may be especially strong among young men because they are the ones who feel most threatened by women’s progress. Better jobs for women need not mean worse ones for men—but many men think it does. Older men are less bothered, since they are more likely to be established in their careers or retired. Younger men, by contrast, are just starting out, so they “are most likely to perceive women’s competition as a potential threat to their future life course”, argue Dr Off, Dr Charron and Dr Alexander. In a recent study, they found that young European men are especially likely to resent women (and feel that feminism has gone too far) if unemployment has recently risen in their area, and if they perceive their society’s institutions to be unfair. Anti-feminist views, they add, are a fair predictor of right-wing authoritarian ones.

**相比之下，右翼的一些政治家找到了与不满男性联系的方法。** 唐纳德·特朗普就是一个明显的例子。美国生活调查中心的Cox表示，他树立了“男子气概和男子气概形象”。他通过出现在终极搏击锦标赛活动中吸引了不关注新闻的年轻男性。他还“在文化冲突中倾向于支持男性”。2018年，他谴责在强奸和性侵案件中舒缓了举证责任转变的情况：“对于美国的年轻男性来说现在是一个非常可怕的时刻，你可能会被指控你没有犯的罪……这是目前发生的非常非常糟糕的事情之一。” 进步人士可能将此解读为一个序列性侵者的自私抱怨。但有理由相信，特朗普的大男人气概“与年轻男性产生共鸣”，Cox说。

Not all male grumbles are groundless. In some countries, divorce courts tend to favour the mother in child-custody disputes. In others, pension rules are skewed. Men enter the labour market earlier and die younger, but the retirement age for women in rich countries is on average slightly lower. In Poland it is five years lower, so a Polish man can expect to work three times longer than he will live post-retirement, while for a Polish woman the ratio is 1.4, notes Michał Gulczyński of Bocconi University. This strikes many men as unfair. Mateusz, the Polish fireman, recalls when a left-wing lawmaker was asked, if she was so keen on equal rights, what about equalising the pension age? “She changed the subject,” he scoffs.

**没有一方很好地解决了导致年轻男性和女性疏离的根本问题。** 政策制定者应该更深入地思考如何让学校为表现不佳的男生提供帮助。Reeves先生建议雇佣更多男性教师，并默认情况下男孩们应该晚一年开始上学，因为他们比女孩发展得更慢。此外，由于“劳动力市场的去种族化几乎完全是单向的”，国家可以加强职业培训，使年轻男性为他们目前回避的职业做好准备，比如涉及健康、教育或行政任务的职业。如果此类改革有助于更多男孩和男性适应一个不断变化的世界，那将使男性和女性受益。■

Another factor that particularly affects young men is conscription. They are the first to be called up; women are often exempt. In South Korea, where military service is universal for men and notoriously gruelling, it fuels male resentment. In Europe conscription is no longer common, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made young men in neighbouring countries, such as Poland, more scared they may be drafted, says Mr Gulczyński.

Social media, the lens through which young people increasingly view the world, may have aggravated polarisation. First, they let people form echo chambers. When homogenous groups of like-minded people discuss an issue, they tend to become more extreme, as individuals vie for affirmation by restating the in-group’s core position in ever-stronger terms, and denouncing those who dispute it.

When groups of frustrated young men link up online, the conversation often descends into misogyny. In male-dominated Chinese chatrooms the phrase “feminist whore” is common, along with a pun that inserts the character for “fist” into “feminist” to make it sound more aggressive.

Once a man joins an angry online group, the pressure to remain in it is strong. Benjamin, a student in Washington, DC, says he used to be a “red-pill guy …working as a janitor, eating McDonalds and wallowing in self-pity”. He’d watch classes online about how to boost his self-confidence and pick up women. When he quit the manosphere, his friends taunted him as a “blue-pill” (someone fooled by the establishment) or a “cuck” (a weak man).

Second, algorithms hook users with content that terrifies or infuriates, making the world seem both more frightening and more unjust than it is. Women who click on #MeToo stories will see more of them; ditto for men who click on stories of men being falsely accused of rape. Each may gain an exaggerated idea of the risks that they personally face.

“When you go into a gym to work out and a woman’s in your line of vision, you look at her and all of a sudden you’re famous on TikTok for being a sexual harasser or something,” says Kahlil Rose, a 28-year-old conservative man in Atlanta. This has not happened to anyone he knows. But he has seen it on his phone, so it looms large in his consciousness. Benjamin, the student in Washington, offers a similarly gloomy perspective: “Men my age are afraid to get married because they hear a cautionary tale: woman cheats, files for divorce and takes everything he worked for.”

Women see a different world online. Julia Kozik, a student in Warsaw, follows a tip she saw on TikTok. When she rides in a cab, she tears out a strand of hair and puts it under the seat in case she is abducted and the police need DNA evidence. “I avoid men at all costs, mostly,” she says.

The political left has done a fair job of persuading women that it cares about their problems. But it has not figured out how to talk to men, argues Richard Reeves, a liberal scholar, in “Of Boys and Men”. Progressives often assume “that gender inequality can only run one way, that is, to the disadvantage of women”. And they apply labels like “toxic masculinity” so indiscriminately as to suggest that there is something intrinsically wrong with being male. Rather than drawing immature boys and men into a dialogue about their behaviour, this “is much more likely to send them to the online manosphere, where they will be reassured they did nothing wrong and that liberals are out to get them”.

Some politicians on the right, by contrast, have found ways to connect with disgruntled males. Donald Trump is an obvious example. He cultivates “an image of virility and manliness”, argues Mr Cox of the Survey Centre on American Life. He appealed to young men who don’t follow the news by showing up at an Ultimate Fighting Championship event. He also tends “to side with men in cultural conflicts”. In 2018 he decried what he said was a shift in the burden of proof in cases of rape and sexual assault: “It’s a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something you may not be guilty of...That’s one of the very, very bad things that’s taking place right now.” Progressives may dismiss this as the self-interested griping of a serial abuser. But there’s reason to believe that Mr Trump’s macho behaviour “resonates with young men”, says Mr Cox.

What neither side has done well is to tackle the underlying problems that are driving young men and women apart. Most important, policymakers could think harder about making schools work for underperforming boys. Mr Reeves suggests hiring more male teachers, and having boys start school a year later, by default, since they mature more slowly than girls do. Also, since “the desegregation of the labour market has been almost entirely one-way”, the state could beef up vocational training to prepare young men for occupations they currently shun, such as those involving health, education or administrative tasks. If such reforms help more boys and men adjust to a changing world, that would benefit both men and women. ■

沙特阿拉伯的投资基金面临一项不可能完成的任务 (Saudi Arabia’s investment fund has been set an impossible task)
====================================================================================

它必须实现令人瞠目结舌的回报，同时推动向后石油时代的转型。 (It must earn eye-watering returns while speeding the shift to a post-oil economy)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![沙特阿拉伯利雅得的夜景](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FNP004.jpg)

大约十年前，一位引人注目、资金雄厚的投资者登场了。沙特阿拉伯的公共投资基金（PIF）被授权大干一场，并做好了准备：它斥资35亿美元收购了优步的股份，向全球最大的科技投资基金——软银的愿景基金投入了450亿美元，并为由大型私募巨头黑石运营的400亿美元基础设施基金提供了一半的资本。自那时起，它已经在从希思罗机场和任天堂到好莱坞制片厂和法国酒店等各种项目中入股。去年，该基金投放了超过300亿美元的新资本，使其成为全球支出最高的主权财富基金（详见图表）。

About a decade ago, a flashy, deep-pocketed investor made an appearance. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) had a mandate to go big, and was ready to: it picked up a $3.5bn stake in Uber, placed $45bn in the world’s largest technology-investment fund, SoftBank’s Vision Fund, and provided half the capital for a $40bn infrastructure fund run by Blackstone, a private-equity giant. It has since bought stakes in everything from Heathrow Airport and Nintendo to Hollywood studios and French hotels. Last year it deployed more than $30bn of fresh capital, making it the highest-spending wealth fund in the world (see chart).

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FNC802.png)

然而，尽管PIF在国外挥金如土，但其在本土的任务变得更为重要。这是因为沙特阿拉伯王储穆罕默德•本•萨勒曼的“2030愿景”计划旨在改造沙特阿拉伯经济，而PIF被指望在其中扮演至关重要的角色。根据“2030愿景”，该基金被指示每年在国内投资至少1500亿里亚尔（400亿美元）。意图是将其持有的资产从3.5万亿里亚尔增加到7.5万亿里亚尔，以期在经济摆脱对石油的依赖的同时创造数百万个就业机会。在2022年的强劲表现之后，去年沙特王国的国内生产总值下降了0.9%，这是自2002年以来的最糟糕表现，除了疫情或金融危机年份之外，使得任务变得更加紧迫。

Yet even as the PIF splurges abroad, its mandate at home is becoming more important. That is because of crown prince Muhammad bin Salman’s plan to transform Saudi Arabia’s economy, known as “Vision 2030”, in which the PIF is expected to play a vital role. It has been instructed to invest at least 150bn riyals ($40bn) at home each year. The intention is also to raise its holdings from 3.5trn riyals to 7.5trn riyals by the end of the decade, with luck creating millions of jobs as the economy moves away from oil. After a strong 2022, the kingdom’s gdp fell by 0.9% last year—its worst performance since 2002, aside from years of pandemic or financial crisis—making the task more urgent.

PIF作为沙特经济的关键支柱，使其与其他任何一个主权财富基金或公共养老基金都不同。挪威的中央银行投资管理局、新加坡政府投资公司和卡塔尔的主权基金都有着不同于本国养老基金和财政部的任务和管理。新加坡政府投资公司必须填补政府预算，但其投资目标是专注于获利。在卡塔尔，国家基金主要在国外进行投资。随着PIF试图实现其政治主人的雄心壮志，它面临着三大挑战。

The PIF’s role as a fulcrum of the Saudi economy means it is unlike any other sovereign-wealth or public-pension fund. Norges Bank Investment Management, Norway’s sovereign-wealth fund, has tasks and governance that are distinct from the country’s pension fund and finance ministry. Singapore’s GIC has to replenish its government’s budget, but its investments are focused on profits. In Qatar the state fund mainly invests abroad. As the PIF attempts to meet the ambitions of its political masters, it faces three challenges.

第一个挑战涉及融资。目前，PIF大部分资金来自政府的资产转让和资本注入。3月7日，沙特政府宣布将沙特阿美公司8%价值约1640亿美元的股权转让给该基金，从而使其在该国家油巨头的股份翻倍。该基金还从投资和持股中获得股息，并可以借助债券市场。去年，它通过国际资本市场发行债券筹集了110亿美元，并今年已经筹集了50亿美元。此外，该基金去年至少借入了120亿美元的长期贷款。此外，中央银行的外汇储备以前也曾转移到该基金。

The first concerns funding. The PIF currently receives most of its capital through asset transfers and capital injections from the government. On March 7th the Saudi government revealed that 8% of Saudi Aramco’s equity, worth about $164bn, had been transferred to the fund, doubling its stake in the state oil giant. The fund also receives dividends from investments and holdings, and can tap debt markets. It raised $11bn by issuing bonds on international capital markets last year, and has already raised another $5bn this year. On top of this, the fund borrowed at least $12bn in long-term loans last year. In the past, the central bank’s foreign-currency reserves have been transferred to it, too.

这些资金来源中的许多将面临压力。该基金不仅被要求继续增加支出，而且随着对石油需求减缓，沙特政府的慷慨将减少。到2030年，将有数以百万计的沙特人加入劳动力市场。政府雇佣许多本地人，工资比私营部门高，工资占总支出的40%，这将加重其预算压力。PIF部分拥有的国内公司的老板们现在谈论着削减成本。由于该基金热衷于债券市场，利息支出也在增长。截至去年9月末，其现金从2022年底的约500亿美元降至150亿美元左右。

Many of these sources will come under pressure. Not only is the fund expected to keep spending more, but as demand for oil slows the Saudi government will become less munificent. By 2030 millions more Saudis will have entered the workforce. The state employs many locals on higher wages than the private sector, with salaries counting for 40% of its total spending, meaning this will strain its budget. Bosses at domestic firms, many part-owned by the PIF, now talk of cost-cutting. And since the fund has eagerly tapped debt markets, interest payments are growing. Its cash dropped to $15bn at the end of September, from around $50bn at the end of 2022.

PIF希望促进沙特经济各个领域的增长，这意味着它投资于处于不同发展阶段的公司，这增加了保持稳定回报的难度。在过去的五年中，该基金成立了93家公司。在从医疗到体育和旅游等13个“战略”领域中，回报差异很大。投资组合公司包括房地产开发商ROSHN、正在建设中的庞大智能城市NEOM和尚未开始运营的航空公司Riyadh Air。

The PIF’s desire to boost growth across the Saudi economy also means it invests in firms at various stages of evolution, complicating efforts to sustain consistent returns. Over the past five years the fund has established 93 companies. Over the 13 “strategic” sectors that the PIF has been tasked with developing, from health to sports and tourism, returns vary widely. Portfolio companies range from ROSHN, a property developer, to NEOM, a vast smart-city under construction, and Riyadh Air, an airline yet to become operational.

所有这些导致了PIF的第二个挑战：提高回报率。自2017年被交付实施“2030愿景”以来，其投资回报率约为8%。这仅略高于其最低目标7%，但远低于其真正旨在实现的私募股权风格的回报率，一位高管承认。这样的雄心比大多数主权财富基金所追求的更为高远，也更为保守，因为要通过多样化的投资组合和如此庞大的资金池实现高回报是非常困难的。到目前为止，PIF已能够选择既有发展潜力又能带来强劲回报的资产，并通过这些持股获取股息。随着其角色的扩大，这将变得越来越困难。

All of this leads to the PIF’s second challenge: boosting returns. Since 2017, when the fund was tasked with implementing Vision 2030, its investments have returned about 8% a year. This is just above its minimum target of 7%, but far below the private-equity-style returns it really aims to achieve, admits one executive. Such ambitions are loftier than those pursued by most sovereign-wealth funds, which are more reserved owing to the difficulties of making big returns with diversified holdings and such large pools of money. So far the PIF has been able to pick assets that promise both economic development and strong returns, while tapping dividends from these holdings. As its role expands, that will become increasingly difficult.

此外，私募股权风格的估值方法，依赖于过去的业绩和未来现金流的预测，很难应用于PIF目前正在投资的许多公司和项目。例如，NEOM的建设预计将耗资大约5000亿美元。然而，它何时以及如何开始提供稳定的现金流还有待争论，这使得这笔投资更类似于风险投资。在其他领域，如医疗和基础设施，该基金的角色具有影响力投资的特点，其目标是既实现一定的社会目标又获得利润。哈佛商学院的研究人员和世界银行旗下的国际金融公司表示，这种投资通常的特点是随着规模扩大而回报下降，并在长期持有时表现更好。随着PIF的扩张，另一个问题正在浮现：投资组合公司经常重叠并相互竞争，从而削弱了回报。实际上，这意味着把钱从左口袋拿出来放到右口袋里，这位高管叹了口气。

Moreover, private-equity-style valuation methods, which depend on past performance and projections of future cash flows, are tough to apply to many of the companies and projects in which the PIF is now investing. NEOM, for instance, is expected to cost around $500bn. But how and when it will begin to offer consistent cash flow is up for debate, making the investment more akin to a venture-capital one. In other areas, such as health and infrastructure, the fund’s role has the air of impact investing, where the goal is to achieve certain social ends as well as secure profits. This sort of investment is normally characterised by returns that deteriorate with scale and perform better when held for a long time, according to researchers from Harvard Business School and the International Finance Corporation, part of the World Bank. As the PIF expands, another problem is emerging: portfolio firms often overlap and compete with one another, cannibalising returns. In effect, this means taking money from your left pocket to put in your right, the executive sighs.

最后一个挑战是吸引外国投资进入沙特阿拉伯。随着该基金规模的扩大，外国资金将有助于实现其雄心壮志。它还将使国内企业扩大业务范围并进入新市场，从而减少它们之间可能陷入的竞争。这将促使PIF退出一些投资，推动私营部门自行解决问题。

The final challenge is attracting foreign investment into Saudi Arabia. As the fund grows bigger, foreign money would assist its ambitions. It would also enable domestic firms to expand their horizons and access new markets, thereby reducing the chances of ending up in competition with one another. And it would allow the PIF to exit some of its investments, which would push the private sector to fend for itself.

但去年，在国际货币基金组织批准的数据修订后，沙特阿拉伯在前三个季度仅吸引了530亿里亚尔的外国直接投资，相当于国内生产总值的2%。到2030年，目标是增加这个数字的一倍以上。一位沙特部长表示：“我们可以等待投资者，但那需要时间，所以让我们开始行动[自己]，同时对其他人表示欢迎。”这可能需要很长时间。到目前为止，全球投资者似乎更愿意接受沙特阿拉伯的资金，而不是将自己的资金投入该国。■

But last year, after an IMF-approved data revision, Saudi Arabia attracted just 53bn riyals in foreign direct investment in the first three quarters, an amount equivalent to 2% of GDP. The aim is to entice over double that by 2030. “We can wait for investors but it will take time, so let’s go and do it [ourselves],” says a Saudi minister, “while being inviting to others.” It could be a very long wait. So far, global investors seem happier to take Saudi Arabia’s money than to put their own money into the country. ■

NIMBY们如何增加碳排放 (How NIMBYs increase carbon emissions)
=================================================

对新建筑的反对带来不良后果。 (Opposition to new buildings has unfortunate consequences)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

![插图，一个男人透过一团烟雾越过篱笆看东西](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FND000.jpg)

**小店主的儿子打破了一扇窗户，引发了人群围观。人们告诉店主不要生气：事实上，打破的窗户是值得庆祝的，因为这将为玻璃匠创造工作。在这个故事中，人群设想了修理窗户所需的工作，但没有考虑店主本可以用钱进行的其他一切——这些未见之可能性本可以给他带来更大的幸福。这个寓言由19世纪经济学家弗雷德里克·巴斯夏创作，旨在引起对一个常见的论点的关注，这个论点后来被称为**破窗理论的谬误**。**

A shopkeeper’s son smashes a window, causing a crowd to gather. Its members tell the shopkeeper not to be angry: in fact, the broken window is a reason to celebrate, since it will create work for the glazier. In the story, the crowd envisions the work involved in repairing the window, but not that involved in everything else on which the shopkeeper could have spent his money—unseen possibilities that would have brought him greater happiness. The parable, written by Frédéric Bastiat, a 19th-century economist, sought to draw attention to a common form of argument, which has come to be known as the broken-window fallacy.

**如果今天窗户被打破，人群可能会有不同的反应，特别是如果他们是反对当地建筑的nimbys。他们可能关心的是店主的儿子打破窗户时释放的“体现碳”。生产一块玻璃板可能需要超过1000°C的温度。如果熔炉由煤炭等燃料提供动力，那么更换窗户将带来可观的碳成本。同样，建筑中的砖块、混凝土和玻璃都是过去排放的产物。它们被认为是体现碳的块状物。**

If the window were to be broken today, the crowd might have a different reaction, especially if they were nimbys who oppose local construction. Their concern might be with the “embodied carbon” the shopkeeper’s son had released when breaking the window. The production of a pane of glass can require temperatures of more than 1,000°C. If the furnace is fuelled by, say, coal, the replacement window would carry a sizeable carbon cost. Similarly, the bricks, concrete and glass in a building are relics of past emissions. They are, the logic goes, lumps of embodied carbon.

**保护现有事物，而不是增加建筑存量，将避免增加这些体现排放——这是nimbys经常提出的建议。这一论点正在证明其有效性。3月12日，欧盟通过了一项指令，要求2030年后建造的建筑物在其整个寿命周期内产生零排放。旧金山市要求潜在的建筑者遵循“体现碳减少策略清单”，其中建议首先是“少建，多重复利用”。上个月，英国政府试图阻止百货公司Marks & Spencer在伦敦重建其旗舰店的提议，理由是拆除将释放4万吨体现碳。**

Conserving what already exists, rather than adding to the building stock, will avoid increasing these embodied emissions—or so NIMBYs often suggest. The argument is proving to be an effective one. On March 12th the EU passed a directive requiring buildings constructed after 2030 to produce zero emissions over their lifetime. The city of San Francisco directs would-be builders towards an “embodied-carbon-reduction-strategies checklist”, which starts with the suggestion that they should “build less, reuse more”. Last month the British government attempted to quash proposals from Marks & Spencer, a department store, that would involve rebuilding its flagship shop in London, on the grounds demolition would release 40,000 tonnes of embodied carbon.

**在最糟糕的情况下，这些裁决基于一种扭曲的逻辑。已经因建造现有建筑而释放的温室气体将加剧全球变暖，无论这栋建筑变得荒废、翻新还是拆除。这些排放已经从世界的“碳预算”中扣除，因此将它们视为新的负债就等于重复计算。即使避免这种错误，体现排放也必须小心处理。正确的问题是一个更简单的问题：值得使用剩余的碳预算来翻新一栋建筑，还是最好拆除它？**

At their worst, such rulings are based on a warped logic. Greenhouse gases that have been released by the construction of an existing building will heat the planet whether the building becomes derelict, is refurbished or is knocked down. The emissions have been taken out of the world’s “carbon budget”, so treating them as a new debit means double counting. Even when avoiding this error, embodied emissions must be treated carefully. The right question to ask is a simpler one: is it worth using the remaining carbon budget to refurbish a building or is it better to knock it down?

**在这些可能性之间做出选择需要考虑未见之物。过去有人说，建筑会产生两种类型的排放。除了混凝土、玻璃和金属中的体现排放外，还有来自住户制冷、供暖和提供电力的运营排放。将建筑翻新以提高能源效率的额外体现碳成本可以以较低的运营碳成本节省为理由。据慈善机构世界绿色建筑委员会称，全球建筑占年排放量的39%，其中28个百分点来自运营碳。**

Choosing between these possibilities requires thinking about the unseen. It used to be said that construction emitted two types of emissions. As well as the embodied sort in concrete, glass and metal, there were operational ones from cooling, heating and providing electricity to residents. The extra embodied-carbon cost of refurbishing a building to make it more energy-efficient can be justified on the grounds of savings from lower operational-carbon costs. Around the world, buildings account for 39% of annual emissions, according to the World Green Building Council, a charity, of which 28 percentage points come from operational carbon.

**对于设计独立建筑的建筑师来说，这两种排放可能就足够了。但在涉及更广泛问题时，经济学家还应考虑建筑物的布置如何影响人们工作、购物，特别是旅行。建筑环境塑造了经济，进而影响了排放。如同慢慢推进绿色转型的耽搁所造成的排放部分归因于否认气候变化的人一样，nimbys也在一定程度上对被迫住在郊区比他们工作更远的居民的排放负有责任。**

These two types of emissions might be enough for the architects designing an individual building. But when it comes to broader questions, economists ought also to consider how the placement of buildings affects the manner in which people work, shop and, especially, travel. The built environment shapes an economy, and therefore its emissions. In the same way as the emissions from foot-dragging over the green transition are in part the responsibility of climate-change deniers, so NIMBYs are in part responsible for the emissions of residents who are forced to live farther from their work in sprawling suburbs.

**对大多数nimbys来说，被阻止住进新住房的居民是被忽略的。然而，无论他们住在哪里，他们仍然会有碳足迹，如果他们能搬到城市，这个足迹会更小。密度降低了公共交通的每人成本，从而减少了汽车使用。这也意味着其他地方可以提供更多土地给自然。一个压力团体Green Alliance的研究表明，在英国，一项“拆除和密集化”的政策——在公共交通附近用公寓替换半独立住房——将在一个典型建筑的60年寿命内节省大量排放。如果没有这样的拆迁，潜在居民通常将不得不搬到郊区，节省房租费用但消耗更多能源，即使政府成功让更多司机使用电动汽车。尽管绿色基础设施、电塔和风力涡轮机都带有体现碳，但不建造它们也将带来排放，即继续使用化石燃料的排放。**

To most NIMBYs, the residents who are prevented from living in new housing are an afterthought. Yet wherever else they live, they still have a carbon footprint, which would be lower if they could move to a city. Density lowers the per-person cost of public transport, and this reduces car use. It also means that more land elsewhere can be given over to nature. Research by Green Alliance, a pressure group, suggests that in Britain a policy of “demolish and densify”—replacing semi-detached housing near public transport with blocks of flats—would save substantial emissions over the 60-year lifespan of a typical building. Without such demolition, potential residents would typically have to move to the suburbs instead, saving money on rent but consuming more energy, even if the government succeeds in getting more drivers into electric vehicles. Although green infrastructure, pylons and wind turbines all come with embodied carbon, not building them comes with emissions, too, from the continued use of fossil fuels.

**因此，逐案决定这样的选择毫无意义。英国的规划系统，其中政府考虑一个特定百货店是否会阻碍达到净零排放的国家目标，尤其愚蠢。更明智的方法是使用碳定价，而不是依靠中央规划者的判断。对可以用于新的物质基础设施以及人们在家中使用的服务的剩余碳预算定价意味着必须考虑到每种方法的真实气候成本。在这样的制度下，靠近公共交通的节能住宅将更有价值。具有较低体现碳的建筑将更便宜。拆除和密集化的开发商通常将获得更大的利润。**

Deciding such choices on a case-by-case basis makes little sense. Britain’s planning system, in which the government considers whether one particular department store will derail the national target to reach net-zero emissions, is especially foolish. The more sensible approach is to use a carbon price, rather than a central planner’s judgment. Putting a price on the remaining carbon budget that can be used for new physical infrastructure, as well as the services that people use in their homes, means that the true climate cost of each approach has to be taken into account. Under such a regime, energy-efficient homes close to public transport would be worth more. Those with less embodied carbon would be cheaper to build. Developers that demolished and densified would therefore often be rewarded with larger profits.

**有针对性的补贴，特别是用于建筑材料研究和开发的补贴，以及最低效率标准，可以增强碳定价的影响，加快建筑环境脱碳的步伐。然而，永远行不通的是让最响亮的声音决定如何利用土地，忽视他们未来邻居的碳排放一旦他们离开视线就消失。■**

Targeted subsidies, especially for research and development into construction materials, as well as minimum-efficiency standards, could bolster the impact of carbon pricing, speeding up the pace at which the built environment decarbonises. What will never work, however, is allowing the loudest voices to decide how to use land and ignoring the carbon emissions of their would-be neighbours once they are out of sight. ■

中国大量生产太阳能电池板——搅乱了沙市场 (China is churning out solar panels—and upsetting sand markets)
=================================================================================

寻找二氧化硅浓度高于99.9%的砂粒 (The hunt for grains with a silica concentration of more than 99.9%)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![位于印度布巴内斯瓦尔附近Kuakhai河的挖沙机械](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FNP002.jpg)

**沙**随处可见。然而，只有某种特定类型的沙才能用于制造智能手机和太阳能板所需的**超清**晰玻璃。它的二氧化硅浓度必须超过99.9%，而建筑材料的浓度低于80%。这种**高质量**的沙很稀缺：每年开采的约500亿吨沙中，不到1%可用于生产常规玻璃。其中只有极小部分足够纯净，可用于太阳能板。

Sand is everywhere. Yet only a certain sort can be used to make the ultra-clear glass required for smartphones and solar panels. It must have a silica concentration of more than 99.9%, against less than 80% for construction material. This high-quality sand is scarce: of the 50bn or so tonnes extracted each year, less than 1% can be used to produce regular glass. A tiny fraction of that is pure enough for solar panels.

随着中国领导人试图振兴该国经济，并使其远离房地产，他们正在大力投资制造业企业。结果很可能是生产激增，尤其是在习近平认为对中国未来至关重要的**领域**，如锂离子电池、电动汽车和太阳能电池板，这些领域需要大量的沙。因此需求可能会进一步上涨。价格已经接近创纪录的高点；去年价格约为每吨55美元左右。

As China’s leaders seek to revive the country’s economy, and to rebalance it away from property, they are throwing cash at manufacturing firms. The result is likely to be a surge in production, especially in sectors that Xi Jinping sees as important to China’s future, such as lithium-ion batteries, electric cars and solar panels, many of which require vast amounts of sand. As a result, demand will probably rise higher still. Prices are already hovering near record highs; last year they came to around $55 a tonne.

**市场**不透明且分散。但数据公司Crux Investor指出，由于**绿色**制造的扩张和智能手机日益普及，过去五年中**高质量**沙的价格上涨了两倍，比低质量沙的价格上涨多，价格受到支撑。大多数亚洲国家限制出口以防止环境恶化，这也推高了价格。在美国，由于细沙主要在淡水河流中发现，严格的法规使开采难以进行。

The market is opaque and fragmented. But Crux Investor, a data firm, notes that the price of high-quality sand has risen twice as much as that of lower-quality stuff over the past five years, owing to the expansion of green manufacturing and the growing popularity of smartphones. Prices are buoyed by the fact that most Asian countries control exports so as to prevent environmental degradation. In America, where fine sand is mostly found in freshwater rivers, tough regulation makes extraction hard.

一些制造商现在正在寻找替代方案。一个选择是提炼用于普通玻璃的沙，这种沙倾向于含有99.5%的二氧化硅。问题在于这样做本身是昂贵的。

Some manufacturers are now looking for alternatives. One option is to refine sand used for regular glass, which tends to be 99.5% silica. The problem is that doing so is itself expensive.

因此，合法和非法的矿工都看到了一个机会。估计黑市价值每年数千亿美元，可能会增长。据矿商Homerun Resources的Brian Leeners称，澳大利亚和巴西或许最有利于从这一法律热潮中受益。尽管这些国家更以其闪亮的白色沙滩而闻名，但它们也拥有大量的工业沙储备。这些储备通常距离人类聚居地更远，使得开采更加简单。矿业公司报告说，直到最近，沙的价格还不够高以支付运输成本。不过价格的大幅上涨改变了这种情况。

Miners, both legitimate and otherwise, therefore spy an opportunity. The black market, estimated to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year, is likely to grow. Australia and Brazil are perhaps best placed to profit from the legal boom, according to Brian Leeners of Homerun Resources, a miner. Although these countries are best known for their sparkling white beaches, they also have significant reserves of industrial sand. These reserves are often farther from human settlements than those elsewhere, making extraction simpler. Mining companies report that until recently the price of sand was not high enough to cover shipping costs. Soaring prices have changed the equation.

这两个国家都不在中国的影响范围内。因此，它们可能有助于使西方供应链更具韧性。Leeners先生指出，巴西的航运航道也不太容易中断，因为它们避开了饱受旱灾侵袭的巴拿马运河和遭到胡塞叛乱分子轰炸的红海。其他对于**绿色**转型至关重要的大宗商品，包括钴、镍和锂，价格也出现了飙升，之后随着发现新供应或更廉价的替代品而下跌。一旦获得开采许可，**高质量**沙可能是下一个沿着这条路径前进的商品。然而，对许多制造商来说，等待将会是一个不舒服的过程。■

Neither country is in China’s sphere of influence. As such, they may help make Western supply chains more resilient. Mr Leeners points out that Brazil’s shipping lanes are also less prone to disruption, since they avoid the drought-hit Panama Canal and the Red Sea, which is under bombardment by Houthi rebels. Other commodities essential for the green transition, including cobalt, nickel and lithium, have seen prices jump, only to fall subsequently when new supplies or cheaper alternatives are discovered. Once permits have been acquired for extraction, high-quality sand could be the next to follow this path. The wait will, however, be an uncomfortable one for many manufacturers.■

俄罗斯经济再次挑战末日预言者 (Russia’s economy once again defies the doomsayers)
===============================================================

随着选举临近，弗拉基米尔·普京现在看来已将通胀控制在手中 (As an election nears, Vladimir Putin now looks to have inflation under control)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![弗拉基米尔·普京参观新时代强大创意论坛的展览](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FNP001.jpg)

在**俄罗斯**总统**弗拉基米尔·普京** [入侵**乌克兰**](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis) 后的两年里，**俄罗斯**经济一再挑战了末日预言者。广泛预测的2022年春季财务崩溃从未发生。经济陷入衰退，但比预期的要轻，并且迅速过去。**通货膨胀**是[最近的惊吓](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/10/vladimir-putin-is-running-russias-economy-dangerously-hot)。去年，价格迅速上涨；经济学家们认为它们可能失控。甚至普京也感到担忧。 二月份，他敦促官员们“特别考虑”不断上涨的价格。

In the two years following Vladimir Putin’s [invasion of Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis), Russia’s economy has repeatedly defied the doomsayers. A financial collapse, widely predicted in the spring of 2022, never came to pass. The economy fell into recession, but it was less severe than expected and passed quickly. Inflation was the [most recent scare](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/12/10/vladimir-putin-is-running-russias-economy-dangerously-hot). Last year prices accelerated rapidly; economists believed they could spiral out of control. Even Mr Putin was worried. In February he urged officials to give “special consideration” to rising prices.

然而，**俄罗斯**经济似乎再次在证明悲观主义者错误。3月13日公布的数据显示，二月份物价环比上涨0.7%，低于去年年底的1.1%。通货膨胀的年率稳定在约7.5%左右（见下图）。预测者预计它将很快降至仅为4%；家庭对未来通货膨胀的预期平稳。**俄罗斯**总统选举原定于3月15日开始，但我们发行后才开始。结果是既定事实。如果竞争激烈，这些数字对普京也不构成伤害。

Once again, however, the Russian economy seems to be proving the pessimists wrong. Data released on March 13th showed that prices rose by 0.7% month-on-month in February, down from 1.1% at the end of last year. The annual rate of inflation is stabilising at around 7.5% (see chart). Forecasters expect it to fall to just 4% before long; household expectations of future inflation have flattened. Russia’s presidential election was due to begin on March 15th, after we went to press. The result is a foregone conclusion. If it was competitive, these figures would do Mr Putin no harm.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FNC740.png)

去年，**俄罗斯**通货膨胀飙升，这要归因于比**covid-19**大流行期间实施的财政挥霍更大的支出。随着普京加大对**乌克兰**的入侵，他增加了对一切事物的支出，从交通设备和武器到士兵薪水。政府总支出实际上增长了8%。对商品和服务的需求远远超出了经济提供的能力，促使销售商提高他们的价格。工人变得异常难以找到，部分原因是因为成千上万的人被征召，成千上万的人[逃离了这个国家](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/03/25/how-the-war-in-ukraine-is-accelerating-russias-brain-drain)。到去年十月，名义工资的年增速已从年初的11%增长到18%。这在劳动密集型服务行业，如医疗保健和酒店业，引发了价格膨胀。

Russian inflation surged last year owing to a fiscal splurge larger than the one implemented during the covid-19 pandemic. As Mr Putin doubled down on his invasion of Ukraine, he increased spending on everything from transportation equipment and weapons to soldiers’ salaries. Total government outlays rose by 8% in real terms. Demand for goods and services soared beyond the economy’s capacity to provide them, prompting sellers to raise their prices. Workers became particularly difficult to find, not least because hundreds of thousands were called up and tens of thousands [fled the country](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/03/25/how-the-war-in-ukraine-is-accelerating-russias-brain-drain). By October last year nominal wages were growing at an annual pace of 18%, up from 11% at the start of the year. This provoked price inflation in labour-intensive services such as health care and hospitality.

谁应该获得这一好转的功劳？财政部正在提出其主张。去年，其官员成功游说实施了汇率控制措施，强制出口商将外汇存入俄罗斯金融系统。这种巧计可能支撑了卢布，在最近几个月里卢布已升值，降低了进口价格。

Who deserves credit for the turnaround? The finance ministry is advancing its claim. Last year its officials successfully lobbied for exchange-rate controls, which compel exporters to deposit foreign currency in the Russian financial system. The wheeze has probably supported the rouble, which has appreciated in recent months, reducing the price of imports.

中央银行官员认为，财政部的同行是经济上的无知之辈，如果擅自干预市场，就会面临风险。他们认为他们的政策——自**2023年7月以来**将利率翻了一番多——应该为通货膨胀放缓负责，并且他们可能是对的。较高的利率鼓励俄罗斯人把钱存在储蓄账户，而不是花掉。更紧缩的货币政策还遏制了贷款。去年十二月，零售贷款环比增长了0.6%，这个增速是2023年大部分时间的2%的一半。

Central-bank officials think that their peers in the finance ministry are economic know-nothings who mess with markets at their peril. They believe their policy—of more than doubling interest rates since July 2023—should take the credit for the inflation slowdown, and they are probably right. Higher rates have encouraged Russians to put money in savings accounts rather than spending it. Tighter monetary policy has also curbed lending. In December retail lending grew by 0.6% month on month, down from 2% for most of 2023.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FNC464.png)

其他几个中央银行没有如此严厉。然而，**俄罗斯**似乎仍在走向“软着陆”，即通货膨胀放缓而不会压垮经济。现在，经济绩效与入侵前的趋势相一致；去年实际**gdp**增长了超过3%（见下图）。失业率仍然保持在创纪录低位，几乎没有企业困境的迹象。事实上，最近企业倒闭率降至八年来的最低点。与此同时，莫斯科证券交易所希望今年将有20多项首次公开上市，而去年只有9项。最新的经济活动“实时”数据也相当强劲。对于今年**gdp**增长的共识预测为1.7%，因此看起来过于悲观。

Few other central banks have been quite as tough. Yet Russia still seems to be heading for a “soft landing”, in which inflation slows without crushing the economy. The performance of the economy is now in line with its pre-invasion trend; gdp grew in real terms by more than 3% last year (see chart). Unemployment remains at a record low and there is little evidence of corporate distress. Indeed, the rate of business closures recently fell to its lowest in eight years. Meanwhile, the Moscow Exchange is hoping to see more than 20 initial public offerings this year, up from nine last year. And the latest “real-time” data on economic activity are reasonably strong. Consensus forecasts for GDP growth this year of 1.7% therefore look too pessimistic.

**俄罗斯**经济的弹性在一定程度上是过去刺激措施的结果。近年来，企业和家庭积累了大量现金余额，使他们能够继续支出，即使面临高通货膨胀，并且能够避免在借款成本高昂的情况下违约。和世界其他地方一样，对劳动力需求的下降主要导致尚未填补的职位数量减少，而不是雇佣的人数减少。来自招聘网站**HeadHunter** 的数据表明，空缺职位与求职者的比率已停止上升。在最近几个月很难找到工人之后，老板们不愿意除非绝对必要，否则不愿意裁员。

Russia’s economic resilience is in part the consequence of past stimulus. In recent years corporations and households have built up large cash balances, allowing them to continue spending even in the face of high inflation, and avoid default in the face of high borrowing costs. As in other parts of the world, falling demand for labour has mostly resulted in a decline in unfilled vacancies rather than in a lower number of people in employment. Figures from HeadHunter, a recruitment site, suggest that the ratio of open positions to jobseekers has stopped rising. Having struggled to find workers in recent months, bosses are reluctant to let people go unless they absolutely must.

[违反制裁](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/21/even-the-toughest-sanctions-on-russias-war-machine-are-no-substitute-for-military-aid) 也刺激了经济。**俄罗斯**生产设施由西方国家拥有者转为新管理层重新开放，正如中央银行在最近的一份报告中指出的那样。战争开始时，制裁使得**俄罗斯**企业难以采购原材料，推迟了生产。不过，现在，企业已经与“友好”国家建立了持久的供应链。超过一半的商品进口来自中国，是入侵之前的两倍。

[Sanctions-busting](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/21/even-the-toughest-sanctions-on-russias-war-machine-are-no-substitute-for-military-aid) has also juiced the economy. Russian production facilities formerly owned by Westerners have reopened under new management, as the central bank points out in a recent report. At the start of the war, sanctions made it hard for Russian firms to source inputs, delaying production. Now, though, companies have set up durable supply chains with “friendly” countries. Well over half of goods imports come from China, twice the share from before the invasion.

随着新的贸易关系逐渐稳定，**俄罗斯**出口商敢于提高价格，以支撑收入和利润。例如，**俄罗斯**向中国客户提供的石油折扣已经从2022年初的10%多下降到约5%。而且不仅仅是石油。普京夸耀着向中国出口冰淇淋的数量激增，上周他指出他“招待了我的朋友，习近平主席”。

As new trading relationships have bedded in, Russian exporters have dared to raise prices, supporting revenues and profits. The discount on oil Russia offers to Chinese customers, for instance, has fallen from more than 10% in early 2022 to about 5% today. And it is not just oil. Mr Putin boasts about soaring ice-cream exports to China, noting last week that he “treated my friend, President Xi Jinping”, to a lick.

正如每个俄罗斯人所知，通货膨胀永远不可能被真正击败。中央银行官员继续担心通货膨胀预期仍然太高。最大的担忧是卢布可能贬值，要么是因为石油价格下跌，要么是因为再次实施严厉制裁，或者是因为中国失去了支持普京的兴趣。这些都是严肃的担忧。然而，这个被视为社会贱民的经济再次回到正轨。■

As every Russian knows, inflation is never truly defeated. Central-bank officials continue to fret that inflation expectations remain too high. The biggest worry is that the rouble may depreciate, either because of lower oil prices, another round of serious sanctions or if China loses interest in supporting Mr Putin. These are serious concerns. Nevertheless, the pariah economy is once again back on track. ■

私募股权行业存在现金问题 (The private-equity industry has a cash problem)
==========================================================

难怪它的投资者正在抗议。 (Little wonder its investors are protesting)
------------------------------------------------------

![插图，显示一个大气球，一只手把一枚小硬币放入一个人的手中的场景](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FND003.jpg)

你的**私募股权**投资赚了多少钱？对于其他资产类别，比如债券或公开交易的股票，这个问题很容易回答。所需的只是购买时的价格、现在的价格以及两者之间的时间。如何计算私募股权投资的回报率就不那么明显了。资本被指定用于这类投资，但只有当投资公司找到一个项目时才会“调用”它。一旦投资，关于价值的信息就很少了。现金以不规律的间隔以大笔总额退回。

How much money are your private-equity investments making? The question is easy to answer for other asset classes, such as bonds or publicly traded stocks. All that is required is the price paid at purchase, the price now and the time that has elapsed between the two. It is less obvious how returns for private-equity investments should be calculated. Capital is earmarked for such investments, but it is only “called” once the investment firm has found a project. There is little information about value once invested. Cash is returned in lump sums at irregular intervals.

向投资者提供了一系列各种名称的指标，这些投资者被称为“有限合伙人”。这些指标包括irr（内部回报率，根据特定项目的回报率计算）、mom（基金的预估价值，作为支付金额的“倍数”）以及其他十几种指标。所有这些都有缺陷。有些依赖于资产的私人估值，可能会有所夸大；另一些则没有考虑到资本成本。但只要有一个指标保持较高，挑剔似乎是千篇一律的：现金分配占支付资本比例，被称为“dpi”。这与私募股权公司每年向投资它们的养老基金和大学捐赠基金发送的现金份额有关，作为这些投资者所支付现金的一部分。与irr或mom不同，dpi很难操纵，它考虑了用于获取基金的高昂费用。

An alphabet soup of measures are supplied to investors, which are known as “limited partners”. There is irr (the internal rate of return, calculated from returns to a specific project), mom (the estimated value of a fund, as a “multiple of money” paid in) and a dozen more besides. All have flaws. Some rely on private valuations of assets, which might be flattering; others do not take into account the cost of capital. But nitpicking seems pedantic so long as one measure stays high: cash distributions measured as a share of paid-in capital, known as “dpi”. This concerns the money that private-equity firms wire to the pension funds and university endowments that invest in them each year, as a share of the cash those investors have paid in. Unlike irr or mom it is hard to game and takes into account the meaty fees charged for access to funds.

在过去的四分之一个世纪里，私募股权公司每年产生的分配价值约占基金价值的25%。但根据投资银行雷曼兄弟的数据，2022年的分配额暴跌至仅为14.6%。到了2023年，分配额进一步下降至仅为11.2%，为2009年以来的最低水平。投资者变得不耐烦。现在可以在在线零售商亚马逊上购买印有标语“dpi是新的irr”的卫衣和T恤。根据新闻服务公司 *彭博社* 的消息，近期一位投资者出席了一家私募股权公司的年度会议，穿着印有这句标语的衣服。

Over the past quarter of a century, private-equity firms have churned out distributions worth around 25% of fund values each year. But according to Raymond James, an investment bank, distributions in 2022 plunged to just 14.6%. They fell even further in 2023 to just 11.2%, their lowest since 2009. Investors are growing impatient. It is now possible to buy jumpers and t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan “dpi is the new irr” on Amazon, an online retailer. According to *Bloomberg*, a news service,an investor recently showed up to a private-equity firm’s annual meeting wearing one.

dpi下降是可以理解的。随着利率上升，股权估值下降。私募股权管理者可以选择何时出售其投资组合公司。在市场走低的时候，他们为什么要卖出？他们退出投资的可能途径，比如将公司上市或将其出售给另一家公司，几乎已经被堵死。在2000年的互联网泡沫破裂和2007-2009年的全球金融危机后的几年里，私人投资的分配额也下降了。

It is understandable that dpi has fallen. As interest rates climbed, equity valuations dropped. Private-equity managers get to choose when to sell their portfolio companies. Why would they sell in a down market? Possible paths for them to exit investments, such as taking a firm public or selling it to another company, have been all but shut off. In the years following the dotcom bubble, which popped in 2000, and the global financial crisis of 2007-09, distributions from private investments dropped similarly.

尽管如此，此次萎靡可能会比以往的任何一次更为破坏性，有几个原因。首先，对私募股权的配置增加了。养老金依赖于收入流，即从公司股息、债券利息和现在的私募股权分配中获得的收入，以向退休人员支付款项。十几年前，私募股权的偏差年份可能并不那么重要。但现在情况不同了。

Still, this slump might prove more damaging than previous ones, for a couple of reasons. First, allocations to private equity have risen. Pension funds rely on income streams—dividends from companies that they own, coupon payments from bonds and, now, distributions from private equity—to make payments to retirees. A decade or two ago, a lean year from private equity might not have mattered much. Now things are different.

其次，以往的低迷时期与养老金基金和大学捐赠基金几乎没有其他投资机会，但是私募股权管理者却有大量机会的情况相吻合。私募股权取得的最佳回报之一是在危机或泡沫爆破后，管理者可以低价收购公司。但过去两年几乎没有此类机会。随着利率上升，融资安排变得困难；尽管估值下降，但并没有暴跌。结果是公司持有创纪录的价值为2.6万亿美元的“闲置资金” —— 投资者承诺的资本，但尚未投资。与此同时，由于提供高收益，养老基金正急于购买更多债券。

Second, previous lean periods coincided with there being few other investment opportunities for pension funds and university endowments, and plentiful ones for private-equity managers. Some of the best returns private equity has posted have come after crises or the popping of bubbles, when managers could pick up firms for a song. But the past two years have offered few such opportunities. With interest rates high, arranging financing has been difficult; although valuations fell, they did not plummet. The result is that firms are sitting on a record $2.6trn-worth of “dry powder”—capital committed by investors, but not yet invested. At the same time, pension funds are itching to buy more bonds, owing to the high yields that are now on offer.

这种情况可能如何解决？股市正创历史新高，私人市场的估值往往跟随公众市场。首次公开募股的流水线正在填充。退出变得可能。如果这一切继续下去，分配额很可能会开始流动。然而这只是一种未来的可能情景。市场最近的强势反映了最大科技公司的成功，这些公司被对人工智能对利润的预期推高。私募股权基金往往拥有医疗保健和家庭维护公司，而不是软件公司。此外，美国的通胀似乎让人担忧，预示着较高的利率。只有当私募股权投资者再次拿到现金时才能放心。 ■

How might this situation resolve itself? Stockmarkets are reaching all-time highs, and valuations in private markets tend to follow those in public ones. The initial-public-offering pipeline is filling up nicely. Exits are becoming possible. If all this carries on, distributions might well begin to flow. Yet this is just one future scenario. Much of the market’s recent strength reflects the success of the biggest technology firms, which have been pumped up by excitement about what artificial intelligence will do to profits. And private-equity funds tend to own health-care and home-maintenance firms, rather than software ones. Moreover, American inflation looks worryingly stubborn, auguring higher rates. Investors in private equity will only be able to relax when they have their cash in hand once again. ■

牛市即将转向泡沫吗？ (Is the bull market about to turn into a bubble?)
=========================================================

股价飙升。投资者感到高兴，但也感到紧张。 (Share prices are surging. Investors are delighted—but also nervous)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![插图：一头公牛变成了泡沫](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FND001.jpg)

两年前，几乎所有人都一致认为众多泡沫之一正在破裂。一个低利率时代即将结束，动摇着几乎每一个资产类别的基础。股价暴跌，政府债券受到严重冲击，加密货币市场在自由落体。华尔街的末日预言者们洋洋得意地叫嚷着。前一个十年的共识——通胀已死亡，廉价资金将长驻——看起来像是任何以往金融疯狂的群体思维一样荒谬。因此，钟摆即将开始摇摆：从狂热到怀疑，从冒险到囤积现金，从贪婪到恐惧。钟摆会花很长时间才能摇回原点。

Two years ago, pretty much everyone agreed that one of the great bubbles was bursting. An era of rock-bottom interest rates was coming to a close, shaking the foundations of just about every asset class. Share prices were plunging, government bonds were being hammered, crypto markets were in freefall. Wall Street’s prophets of doom were crowing with delight. The consensus of the previous decade—that inflation was dead and cheap money here to stay—looked as ludicrous as the groupthink of any previous financial mania. Thus the pendulum was about to swing: from exuberance to scepticism, risk-taking to cash-hoarding and greed to fear. It would take a long time to swing back.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FNC763.png)

或者并非如此。美国股市的低谷出现在2022年10月。不到18个月后，全球股市再度达到[历史最高水平](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/02/25/stockmarkets-are-booming-but-the-good-times-are-unlikely-to-last)（见图表1）。特别是美国股市正经历着[惊人的上涨](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/04/american-stocks-loiter-near-an-all-time-high)，标普500指数中的大型公司股价在过去19周中有16周上涨。人工智能（AI）关键处理器制造商Nvidia的价值在几个月内增长了1万亿美元以上。比特币于3月14日再创新高。对于那些将前一轮疯狂归咎于接近零利率的人来说，这是令人困惑的，因为这是在中央银行家们进行残酷行动试图将利率拉回较为正常水平之后发生的（见图表2）。一次又一次，关于市场的每一次对话都不可避免地回到同一个问题：这是一个**泡沫**吗？

Or not. The trough in American stocks came in October 2022. Less than 18 months later stockmarkets around the world are back at [all-time highs](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/02/25/stockmarkets-are-booming-but-the-good-times-are-unlikely-to-last) (see chart 1). America’s in particular is on an [eye-popping run](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/04/american-stocks-loiter-near-an-all-time-high), with the S&P 500 index of large firms having risen in 16 of the past 19 weeks. The value of Nvidia, a maker of microprocessors essential for artificial intelligence (AI), has risen by more than $1trn in the space of a few months. Bitcoin hit another record on March 14th. Disorientingly for those who blamed the previous mania on near-zero interest rates, this comes after a brutal campaign by central bankers to yank them back to more normal levels (see chart 2). Once again, every conversation about markets veers unerringly back to the same question: is this a bubble?

对于许多人来说，浮现在脑海中的并非是最近的牛市，而是上世纪90年代末的情景，当时的互联网泡沫膨胀。那时，新技术承诺将生产率和利润推向巅峰，所讨论的创新是互联网而不是人工智能。上世纪90年代，牛市的参与者认为电信领域的进步会改变世界，催生新的企业巨头。然而，很多人最终还是赔得精光，甚至押注于最终取得巨大成功的公司。经典案例是思科，像Nvidia一样，它制造了这个新时代的重要硬件。尽管在最近的财政年度，其净利润达到128亿美元，对比2000年的44亿美元（按今天的货币计算），但那些在2000年3月股价高峰时购买股票并持有至今的投资者实际上已经损失了接近66%。

For many, the parallel that springs to mind is not the most recent bull market but that of the late 1990s, when the dotcom bubble inflated. Then, as now, new technology promised to send productivity and profits to the moon, the innovation in question being the internet rather than artificial intelligence. Bulls in the 1990s were right that advances in telecommunication would transform the world and spawn new corporate giants. Yet plenty still ended up losing their shirts—even by betting on firms that went on to be wildly successful. The canonical example is Cisco, which, like Nvidia, made hardware crucial for the new age. Although in the most recent fiscal year its net profit was $12.8bn, up from $4.4bn in 2000 (both in today’s money), those who bought shares at their peak in March 2000 and are still holding today have taken a real-terms loss of nearly 66%.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FNC768.png)

因此，思科展示了泡沫的决定性特征。当投资者以完全脱离供需或未来现金流等经济基本面的价格购买资产时，泡沫就会膨胀。对于资产的“价值”已经变得毫无意义；唯一重要的是它之后能否卖出更高价格。而这又取决于投机狂热能吸引多少人参与，能持续多久——换句话说，群众发疯程度有多高。一旦买家用尽，疯狂就会消散，价格就无法维持。预测随后的下跌规模与试图顶市一样都是愚人游戏。

Cisco therefore illustrates the defining feature of bubbles. They inflate when investors buy assets at prices that are entirely unmoored from economic fundamentals such as supply and demand or future cash flows. The question of what the asset is “worth” goes out of the window; all that matters is whether it can later be sold for more. That in turn depends on how many people the speculative frenzy can pull in and how long it can last—in other words, how mad the crowd becomes. Once buyers run out, the craze dissipates and there is nothing holding prices up. Predicting the size of the subsequent fall is as much of a fool’s game as trying to time the top.

好消息是，这种狂热还有很长的一段路要走。高盛的研究人员分析了美国标准普尔500指数中前十大股票的估值，这些股票围绕着很大一部分人工智能炒作。按照未来一年预期收益的平均价格来看，它们的价格有点贵，但比去年便宜，与互联网泡沫的高峰相比，则便宜多了，当时股价是预期盈利的43倍。

The good news is that this sort of mania is some way off. Researchers at Goldman Sachs, a bank, have analysed the valuations of the ten biggest stocks in America’s S&P 500 index, around which much of the AI hype has revolved. With prices at an average of 25 times their expected earnings for the coming year, they are on the expensive side. But they are cheaper than they were last year, and a bargain compared with the peak of the dotcom bubble, when prices were 43 times earnings.

还有其他可以显示，尽管股价飙升，欣欣向荣的迹象。美国银行最新的基金经理月度调查发现，他们比两年前更加看涨，但从长期标准来看也不是特别乐观。他们的平均现金持有量较低，但也不是极低，这意味着他们没有拿出全部资金进入市场（也没有囤积现金准备迎接暴跌，像在90年代末那样）。在零售投资者中，通常支撑泡沫最后和最危险阶段的群众，没有出现2021年科技基金和主题股的涌入狂潮的重复。

There are other tell-tale signs that, in spite of soaring share prices, euphoria is absent. Bank of America’s latest monthly survey of fund managers finds them more bullish than they have been for around two years, but not particularly so by long-term standards. Their average cash holdings are low, but not extremely so, meaning that they have not piled into the market with everything they have (and are also not hoarding cash in anticipation of a plunge, which they were in the late 1990s). Among retail investors, the crowd that typically sustains the final and most dangerous stage of a bubble, there has been no repeat of the stampede into tech funds and meme stocks witnessed in 2021.

那么，如果事情开始走向狂热，会是什么情形？一个强烈的信号将是到目前为止集中在少数几只大市值股票上的涨幅开始在更广泛的市场中传播。过去几个月的连胜主要由美国的“七巨头”科技巨头中的四家主导。亚马逊、Meta、微软和Nvidia把标普500指数中其他496只股票远远甩在了身后。这些其他股票反过来从2022年的重挫中复苏得比Russell 2000指数代表的较小公司要好（见图表3）。如果投资者真的开始无所顾忌地投入，可以预期他们将开始押注风险较高的小公司，以及那些成功将“AI”一词塞进年度报告中的巨头。

What, then, would it look like if things were to take a euphoric turn? A strong signal would be for gains that have so far been concentrated in a few mega-cap stocks to spread through the market more broadly. The winning streak of the past few months has been dominated not by America’s “magnificent seven” tech giants, but by just four of them. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia have left the other 496 stocks in the S&P 500 in the dust. Those others, in turn, have recovered from the shellacking of 2022 far better than the smaller firms represented in the Russell 2000 index (see chart 3). If investors really do start throwing caution to the winds, expect them to start betting on riskier corporate minnows as well as on giants—especially those that manage to shoehorn the letters “AI” into their annual reports.

作为推论，首次公开发行（IPO）的管道应该终于开始大量涌现。无论是1999年还是2021年，随着股价上涨和兴高采烈的投资者无法抗拒，IPO市场都开始活跃起来。目前的牛市一个令人困惑的特点是，它发生在IPO荒年。咨询公司安永估计，2023年在美国上市的公司募集的资金仅为230亿美元，而2021年则达到了1560亿美元。也许企业老板只是更担忧经济的不利影响而投资者则没有这么担忧。在一个狂热的市场中，理智变得无法维持。

A corollary is that the pipeline of initial public offerings (IPOs) ought at last to start gushing. In both 1999 and 2021 it got going, with rising share prices and ebullient investors proving irresistible to bosses searching for capital. A puzzling feature of the current bull market is that it has taken place amid an ipo drought. EY, a consultancy, estimates that firms going public in America raised just $23bn in 2023, compared with $156bn in 2021. It might be that bosses are simply more worried about economic headwinds than investors are. In a euphoric market such level-headedness becomes impossible to maintain.

类似的危险也威胁着专业理财人员，他们的工作是击败市场，无论他们认为市场是否运行合理。当股市看起来危险地估值过高时，避免它们是明智之举。但在泡沫中，避开高估值的股票——毕竟是涨幅最大的股票——开始看起来可疑地像是例行中庸。当互联网热潮达到顶峰时，20世纪最受尊崇的对冲基金经理之一朱利安·罗伯逊顽固地拒绝购买科技股票。他的投资者最终发动起义并撤回了资金，迫使他的基金在即将开始崩溃时关闭。因此，另一个标志显示泡沫即将破灭：一些市场上悲观的声音开始发出。

Similar dangers stalk professional money-managers, whose job is to beat the market whether or not they think it is moving rationally. When pockets look dangerously overvalued, it makes sense to avoid them. But in a bubble, avoiding overvalued stocks—which, after all, are the ones rising the most—starts to look suspiciously like routine mediocrity. As the dotcom frenzy reached its peak, Julian Robertson, one of the 20th century’s most revered hedge-fund managers, stalwartly refused to buy tech stocks. His investors eventually revolted and withdrew their money, forcing his fund to close right as the crash was about to start. Hence another sign that a bubble is about to pop: some of the market’s gloomier voices are fired.

投资者似乎还不够兴奋，不会发生以上这些情况。但就像在2021年那样，更便宜的债务可能会帮助他们进入氛围。放贷人正向高风险（或“垃圾”）公司借款人注入资金，缩小他们支付的利率与政府债券收益之间的差额（见图表4）。当美联储官员于3月20日开会时，对即将降息的暗示可能正是投资者寻求的刺激。只需准备好一些退热药，以备不时之需。■

Investors do not yet seem excitable enough for any of this to take place. But as in 2021, cheaper debt could help get them in the mood. Lenders are shovelling money in the direction of risky high-yield (or “junk”) corporate borrowers, narrowing the spread they pay above the yield on government debt (see chart 4). When the Federal Reserve’s officials meet on March 20th, any hint that rate cuts are imminent could be exactly the sort of high for which investors are looking. Just have some paracetamol on hand for the comedown. ■

中国经济的亮点提出警示 (China’s economic bright spots provide a warning)
==========================================================

参观一个乐观港口所展示的景象 (What a visit to an optimistic port reveals)
--------------------------------------------------------

![宁波一家车间的工人检查待出口到美国的电熨斗的质量](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_FNP006.jpg)

如果美国经济开始恶化，宁波的居民将是首批得知情况的人。这座位于中国东部的港口城市拥有960万居民，包含一个庞大的工业区。它的商品准备出口，通过一个深水港口被运往国外，这个港口是世界上最繁忙的之一。浙江省的海岸线上遍布着类似的贸易枢纽，成千上万家主要由家族拥有的企业在过去40年里建立了多样化的制造基地。它们生产从纺织品和汽车零部件到电子产品和机械元件等各种产品。

If America’s economy begins to deteriorate, people in Ningbo will be among the first to know. The eastern Chinese port, home to 9.6m residents, contains a sprawling industrial district. Its goods are prepared for export, and are shipped abroad via a deepwater harbour, which is one of the world’s busiest. The coast of Zhejiang province is dotted with similar entrepôts, where thousands of mostly family-owned firms have built up a diverse manufacturing base over the past 40 years. They make everything from textiles and car parts to electronics and machine components.

宁波也是一个政治重要城市。尽管该地区民营产业蓬勃发展，而不是靠国有企业支持，但它仍然被视为“共同富裕”的典范——这是习近平应对财富不平等的方式。在整体景气不佳的背景下，许多地区陷入房地产危机并受到消费需求疲弱困扰的情况下，出乎意料地强劲出口和美国衰退恐慌的淡化使宁波成为中国最乐观的城市之一。

Ningbo is also a city of political importance. Although private industry, rather than state-backed enterprise, has thrived in the region, it has nevertheless been held up as a model of “common prosperity”—Xi Jinping’s way of dealing with wealth inequality. And amid a gloomy overall outlook, with much of the country mired in a property crisis and suffering from weak consumer demand, surprisingly strong exports and fading fears of a recession in America have combined to make Ningbo one of China’s most optimistic cities.

3月7日发布的官方数据显示，2024年前两个月中国出口同比增长7.1%。考虑到一些分析师预期的增速不到1%，这一数据尤为引人注目。即使对美国的出口也同比增长了5%，此前在去年12月份曾下跌近7%。这些数据令人鼓舞到足以让中国在北京举行的年度全国人大上的决策者提前一天透露了部分数据。

Official data released on March 7th showed that China’s exports surged by 7.1% year on year in the first two months of 2024. This is especially impressive given that some analysts had expected growth of less than 1%. Even exports to America climbed 5% year on year, after having tumbled by nearly 7% in December. The figures were sufficiently encouraging that policymakers at China’s annual congress in Beijing disclosed a version of them a day ahead of the expected release date.

毫不奇怪，宁波的氛围比其他中国城市更加愉快。当地人说，部分原因可以归因于它相对轻松的疫情防控措施。2022年，许多中国大城市长时间处于封锁状态。宁波或许是幸运的，避免了全城封锁，工厂几乎没有关闭。当年4月和5月，上海封城期间，一些本应运往上海港口的卡车被重新路由至宁波繁忙的港口。

Little surprise, then, that the atmosphere in Ningbo is more cheerful than in other Chinese cities. Part of this, locals say, can be attributed to its relatively easy covid-19 years. In 2022 many large Chinese cities were locked down for months on end. Ningbo, perhaps by dint of luck, avoided a full-city lockdown and closed few factories. When Shanghai was shut down in April and May that year, halting lorries bound for its port, some traffic was rerouted to Ningbo’s busy harbour.

然而，幸福感也存在局限，这表明宁波等城市可能不会引领中国经济复苏。外部需求的下降对该地区将是毁灭性的。当中国于2023年初重新开放时，当地工厂曾短暂经历此情况。空集装箱开始在宁波港堆积，表明海外采购量下降。一位去年3月访问过这座城市的官员表示他曾预料到该市和其他出口枢纽将遭受灾难性打击。幸运的是，部分现象可以解释为疫情爆发以来首次大量运回中国的货柜。需求下降只是暂时的。

The good cheer has limits, though, which suggests that cities such as Ningbo may not drive China’s recovery. A downturn in foreign demand would be devastating for the region. Local factories experienced a brief taste of this as China reopened in early 2023. Empty containers began stacking up in Ningbo’s port, indicating a lack of overseas purchases. An official who visited the city last March says he anticipated a disaster for the city and other export hubs. Fortunately, part of the phenomenon was explained by excess shipping containers returning to China for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The drop in demand was a blip.

宁波工厂老板还有其他担忧。他们公司的家族控制性质使得从银行获得融资更加困难。而在南部城市如深圳，较大规模制造商享受政府支持进行技术升级，涉及到机器人和物联网，当地企业发现自己很难跟上脚步。

Ningbonese factory bosses have other concerns. The family-controlled nature of their firms makes financing from banks more difficult to secure. As larger manufacturers in southern cities such as Shenzhen enjoy government support for technology upgrades—involving robotics and the internet of things—local companies are finding it tough to keep pace.

尽管最新的出口数据深得人心，但都是基于一个非常低的基数进行的改善。汇丰银行的分析师预计，贸易不确定性将持续存在。与此同时，需求正在转变：来自贫困市场如非洲和南美洲的需求激增，根据最新数据；来自美国的需求仍然强劲；但来自澳大利亚、欧盟和日本的需求正在下降。

And although the most recent export data beat expectations across the board, things improved from a very low base. Analysts at HSBC, a bank, expect trade uncertainty to persist. Meanwhile, demand is shifting: that from poorer markets, such as Africa and South America, is surging, according to the most recent data; that from America remains strong; but that from Australia, the EU and Japan is falling.

宁波将如何适应？许多制造商最初是供应外国品牌起家的。最近，他们开始通过亚马逊（一个在线市场）以及中国的两个电商网站——托米和SHEIN直接向发达国家的消费者销售产品，诺丁汉宁波分校的Hing Kai Chan指出。他们不太可能已经在目前增长迅猛的市场上建立起类似的渠道。如果发达国家的需求减弱，宁波的愉快日子可能就要结束。中国这座乐观的城市正在倚靠该国地缘政治对手的影响。■

How well will Ningbo adapt? Many manufacturers got their start supplying foreign brands. More recently, they have begun selling directly to customers in the rich world through Amazon, an online marketplace, and Temu and Shein, two Chinese e-commerce sites, notes Hing Kai Chan of the University of Nottingham Ningbo China. They are unlikely to have developed similar channels in the markets now growing strongly. If rich-world demand fizzles out, Ningbo’s happy days could come to an end. Instead of developing a new path to prosperity, China’s optimistic city is riding on the coat-tails of the country’s geopolitical rivals. ■

纽约市到处都是违法脚手架 (New York City is covered in illegal scaffolding)
===========================================================

机器学习算法可能有助于拆除它 (Machine learning algorithms could help bring it down)
------------------------------------------------------------------

![在美国布鲁克林搭建脚手架的孩子。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_STP002.jpg)

那个不眠之城似乎也无法拆除**脚手架**。纽约人已经对这些丑陋的结构以及为了保护和引导行人而设置在地面的围栏感到厌倦，去年市长埃里克·亚当斯启动了一项活动，旨在清除这些脚手架。

The city that never sleeps is also, it seems, unable to take down scaffolding. New Yorkers have grown so sick of the ugly structures, and the accompanying ground-level cages in place to protect and divert pedestrians, that Eric Adams, the mayor, last year launched a campaign to clear them from the streets.

如今，该市的计算机科学家们制定了一份可能清除目标的清单。利用人工智能来筛选成千上万小时的**仪表板**摄像头录像，研究人员确定了五个行政区内约5,000个脚手架站点，其中有500个没有许可证。在曼哈顿康奈尔科技学院工作的计算机科学家温迪·居表示：“这座城市是最好的，但也有点灾难。”

Now computer scientists in the city have made a hit list of possible targets. Using AI to sift through thousands of hours of dashcam footage, the researchers identified some 5,000 scaffolding sites across all five boroughs, of which 500 were found to have no permit. “This city is the best but also kind of a disaster,” says Wendy Ju, a computer scientist at Cornell Tech in Manhattan, who worked on the project.

纽约市不断淹没在**脚手架**下是一个典型的例子，说明善意的政策会产生不良的副作用。（或者在这种情况下，是人行道的副作用。）在1980年被坠落石材导致的死亡惊吓后，官员们引入了每五年进行一次强制外观检查的政策。

New York’s steady submergence beneath scaffolding is a classic example of a well-meaning policy producing bad side-effects. (Or in this case, sidewalk effects.) Shocked by deaths from falling masonry, officials in 1980 introduced compulsory façade inspections every five years.

结果，城市记录显示目前有超过8,000份**脚手架**许可证，其中通常包括纽约人所称的“棚屋”——黑暗而引人压抑的街道隧道。许多**脚手架**在许可证到期后仍然保持不变，因为建筑业主发现在检查之间保留**脚手架**更为方便。作为他对棚屋的持续斗争的一部分，亚当斯先生庆祝了从哈莱姆街上拆除的一座21年历史的**脚手架**，这个**脚手架**本身已成为当地的地标。

As a result, city records show more than 8,000 current permits for scaffolds, which often include what New Yorkers call “sheds”—dark and claustrophobic street-level tunnels. Many remain in place long after the permit expires because building owners find it more convenient to leave the scaffolding in place between inspections. As part of his ongoing war on sheds, Mr Adams celebrated the removal of 21-year-old scaffolding from a Harlem street that had become a local landmark in its own right.

为了从街道水平视角了解问题，康奈尔科学家们训练了一个算法来在图像中找到**脚手架**，然后让其在通过车辆搭乘的摄像头在2023年8月至2024年1月间拍摄的庞大数据集上自由运行。然后，他们要求计算机在29,156,833个地理标记图像中找到所有的棚屋。

To get a street-level view of the problem, the Cornell scientists trained an algorithm to find scaffolding in images and then set it loose on a huge data set collected between August 2023 and January 2024 by cameras fitted to ride-sharing vehicles. They then asked the computer to find all the sheds in a colossal 29,156,833 geotagged images.

研究人员继续将人工智能识别的**脚手架**与已批准项目的记录进行交叉参考。发现的大约500个未经许可的棚屋并不一定违反规定，因为城市法规确实允许一些未经许可的**脚手架**（例如，紧急工作）。但这些地方似乎是一个很好的调查起点。

The researchers went on to cross-reference scaffolding identified by the AI with records of approved projects. The 500 or so unpermitted sheds discovered don’t necessarily contravene the rules, as city regulations do allow some without permission (for emergency work, for instance). But they would seem a good place to start investigating.

科学家们正在等待结果被接受并出席即将举行的会议之前，才会与市政府分享这些结果。他们还希望将数据转化为交互式地图，向居民展示**脚手架**的位置，告诉他们存在的时间长短，以及是否有许可证。很快，纽约市民将再次能够安心入睡。■

The scientists are waiting until the results are accepted for an upcoming conference before sharing them with city officials. They also want to convert the data into an interactive map that will show residents the location of scaffolding, tell them how long it’s been there and reveal whether or not it has a permit. Soon, New Yorkers will be able to sleep easy once again. ■

如何训练你的大型语言模型 (How to train your large language model)
==================================================

一项新技术正在加速这一过程。 (A new technique is speeding up the process)
--------------------------------------------------------

![穿着跑鞋的机器人腿](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_STD001.jpg)

**构建大型语言模型(LLM)**需要大量数据并非秘密。在传统训练中，LLM会被喂入大量文本，并被鼓励在每个词出现之前猜测。随着每次预测，**LLM**会做出微小调整以提高猜测正确的机会。最终的结果是具有一定统计“理解力”的东西，知道什么是合适的语言，什么不是。

It is no secret that building a large language model (LLM) requires vast amounts of data. In conventional training, an LLM is fed mountains of text, and encouraged to guess each word before it appears. With each prediction, the LLM makes small adjustments to improve its chances of guessing right. The end result is something that has a certain statistical “understanding” of what is proper language and what isn’t.

**但是，仅经历了所谓的“预训练”**的LLM还不是特别有用。例如，当要求预先训练的模型GPT-2讲一个笑话来让通讯对象振作起来时，它只是将问题重复三次。当被问及美国总统是谁时，它回答道：“答案是否定的。总统不是总统。”显然，教会LLM做人类想要的事情需要更多的东西。

But an LLM that has only undergone this so-called “pretraining” is not yet particularly useful. When asked for a joke to cheer your correspondent up, for instance, the pretrained model GPT-2 just repeated the question back three times. When asked who the American president was, it responded: “The answer is no. The president is not the president.” Clearly, teaching an LLM to do what humans want requires something more.

**一种将这些模型与用户期望保持一致的方法是通过人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）。美国初创公司OpenAI于2022年3月发布的一篇预印本中介绍了这一技术。它是ChatGPT的一项重要组成部分，后者在八个月后发布。**

One way to align such models with users’ expectations is through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). OpenAI, an American startup, introduced this technique in a preprint published in March 2022. It was a major ingredient in its recipe for ChatGPT, which was released eight months later.

**RLHF通常涉及三个步骤。首先，请人类志愿者选择两个潜在LLM回应中的哪一个可能更适合给定的提示。然后，这个过程重复成千上万次。然后使用这个数据集来培训第二个LLM，实际上充当人类的替身。然后用这个所谓的奖励模型来培训原始LLM，设计成给人类喜欢的回应评分更高，其他一切评分更低。最后，一种名为强化学习的机器学习技术调整原始LLM的旋钮和杠杆，帮助加强获得奖励的行为。**

RLHF normally involves three steps. First, human volunteers are asked to choose which of two potential LLM responses might better fit a given prompt. This is then repeated many thousands of times over. This data set is then used to train a second LLM to, in effect, stand in for the human being. This so-called reward model, designed to assign higher scores to responses a human would like, and lower scores to everything else, is then used to train the original LLM. As a final touch, a machine-learning technique called reinforcement learning tweaks the knobs and levers of the original LLM to help reinforce the behaviours that earn it a reward.

**这种RLHF的做法非常复杂—使用两个独立LLM需要时间和金钱，而用于强化学习的算法就像斯坦福大学的Rafael Rafailov所言“非常痛苦。”这意味着在OpenAI之外，Google及其竞争对手，没有人真正利用它的全部潜力。**

This way of doing RLHF is quite involved—using two separate LLMs takes time and money, and the algorithm used for reinforcement learning is, to quote Rafael Rafailov at Stanford University, “quite painful”. This has meant that, outside of OpenAI, Google and their rivals, nobody has really exploited its full potential.

**现在事实证明，可以以极小的努力取得同样的成果。Rafailov博士及其同事，包括Archit Sharma和Eric Mitchell，于2023年12月在NeurIPS，一个AI会议上提出了这种方法，即Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO)，它依赖于一个令人满意的数学技巧。**

It now turns out that the same results can be achieved for a fraction of the effort. Dr Rafailov and his colleagues, including Archit Sharma and Eric Mitchell, presented this alternative in December 2023 at NeurIPS, an AI conference. Their method, Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO), relies on a satisfying mathematical trick.

**这个技巧的关键在于观察到对于每个奖励模型，都有一个特定的理论LLM将得满分，每个LLM也有一个理论奖励模型将给它最高分数。这个观察到每个LLM隐藏着一个隐含的奖励模型，使研究人员可以直接调整这个模型。在旧的体制中，LLM从奖励模型学习，而奖励模型从数据学习。现在，LLM可以直接从数据中学习。**

This trick hinges on the observation that for every reward model there is a specific theoretical LLM that would get full marks, and every LLM likewise has a theoretical reward model that would give it flying colours. (Just as, more prosaically, every pair of trousers has a theoretical person on whom they would sit perfectly, and every person has a theoretical pair of trousers that would best fit.) This observation that each LLM conceals an implicit reward model allowed the researchers to tinker with this model directly. In the old regime, the LLM learned from the reward model, which learned from the data. Now, the LLM can learn directly from the data.

**根据作者的说法，去除中间人使得DPO比RLHF更高效三到六倍，并且在文本摘要等任务方面具有更好的表现。Sharma博士表示，它的易用性已经让更小的公司能够解决对齐问题。一年前，只有少数一些领先的模型，如谷歌的Gemini和OpenAI的GPT-4，才能够使用RLHF。但截至3月12日，在行业排行榜上排名前十的LLM中，有八个使用了DPO。法国初创公司Mistral，希望挑战OpenAI，正在使用它。社交媒体巨头Meta已将其整合到自家的LLM中。**

According to the authors, removing the middleman makes DPO between three and six times more efficient than RLHF, and capable of better performance at tasks such as text summarisation. Its ease of use is already allowing smaller companies to tackle the problem of alignment, says Dr Sharma. A year ago only a few world-leading models, such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4, could afford to use RLHF. But as of March 12th eight out of the ten highest-ranked LLMs on an industry leaderboard used DPO. [Mistral](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/02/26/meet-the-french-startup-hoping-to-take-on-openai), the French startup seeking to rival OpenAI, uses it. Meta, a social-media giant, has integrated it into a home-grown LLM.

**进一步的改进肯定会到来。首先，共识观点是自从2022年停止发布细节以来，大型AI实验室已经改进了它们的专有算法。但让LLM做出人类期望的事情远未完成。毕竟，即使是其他人类有时也会挣扎。■**

Further improvements are sure to come. For one thing, the consensus view is that the big AI labs have made improvements to their proprietary algorithms since they stopped publishing details in 2022. But the problem of getting an LLM to do what a human would want and expect is far from done and dusted. After all, even other humans occasionally struggle. ■



<hr><span style="color: red;"><b>科学技术 | 四处皆水</b></span> (Science and technology | Water, water, everywhere)

如何从大气中收集水分 (How to harvest moisture from the atmosphere)
=====================================================

新技术可以为地球上最干旱的气候提供水资源。 (New technologies could provide water to Earth’s most arid climates)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![一名老妇人从尼泊尔山区收集水汽形成的水库取水。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_STP001.jpg)

即使在最具猜想性的科幻作品中，**人类**对液态**水**的依赖也是无法逃避的。《星球大战》三部曲的英雄卢克·天行者在他叔叔的水分场长大，从泰图因星球干旱的大气中提取**水**。《沙丘》这部佛兰克·赫伯特的小说（或者距离最近的电影院只有三个小时的任何人）中，沙漠世界阿拉克斯的居民也利用风陷器从空气中偷取珍贵的液体。

Even in the most speculative reaches of science fiction, there is no escaping humanity’s dependence on liquid water. Luke Skywalker, the hero of the original “Star Wars” trilogy, grows up on his uncle’s moisture farm, extracting water from Tatooine’s arid atmosphere. The residents of the desert world Arrakis, accessible to anyone with a copy of Frank Herbert’s novel “Dune” (or with three hours to kill at their nearest cinema), likewise use windtraps to steal precious liquid from the air.

地球上的工程师也越来越多地开始寻找大气中的**水**。他们这样做是有充分理由的。即使在常被称为地球上最干燥的地方的智利阿塔卡马沙漠的深处，估计雾和露可以产生每平方米大约200毫升的**水**。在其他地方，大气层也更加慷慨。全球估计包含着12900立方公里的**水**，大约相当于苏必利尔湖的体积。此外，模型表明，由全球变暖驱动的蒸发将在未来50年内**将**这些水平增加27％。

Engineers on Earth, too, are increasingly looking to the atmosphere for water. They have good reason to do so. Even in the depths of Chile’s Atacama Desert, often called the driest place on Earth, estimates suggest that fog and dew can generate some 200ml of water per square metre. Elsewhere, the atmosphere is even more generous. Worldwide, it is estimated to contain 12,900 cubic kilometres of water, roughly the volume of Lake Superior. Moreover, models indicate that evaporation driven by global warming will increase these levels by 27% over the course of the next 50 years.

**利用**这个看不见的水库是当务之急。随着地球温度的上升和人口的增长，越来越多的人可能会缺**水**。目前有超过23亿人生活在水资源短缺的国家，分析师预测，进一步的干旱将导致大约三分之一的人在2030年之前不得不离开家园。

Tapping this invisible reservoir is a priority. As Earth’s temperatures rise and its population grows, ever more people are likely to run short of water. More than 2.3bn are currently living in water-stressed countries and analysts predict that further droughts will force roughly a third of these to move from their homes by 2030.

**从**空气中收集**水**并非什么新鲜事。被广泛认为发明了这项技术的印加人在树下放置桶，以收集从海上飘来的厚雾的冷凝物。在加那利群岛, 月桂树、刺柏树和松树因为与雾收集有关，已经被称为“泉水树”。居住在阿曼干旱山区的人们长期以来就在树下建造贮水池，原因也是相同。

Collecting water from the air is nothing new. The Inca, who are widely thought to have invented the technique, placed buckets under trees to collect the condensation from heavy fog drifting in off the sea. On the Canary Islands laurels, junipers and pines have come to be known as “fountain trees” for their association with fog harvesting. People dwelling in the arid mountains of Oman have long built cisterns under trees for the same reason.

现代大气中**水**的收集遵循着许多相同的原则。然而，与使用树叶作为冷凝器不同，这些现代陷阱由非常细的聚合物网格片组成。当雾气穿过这些片，微小的**水**滴会粘附在聚合物纤维上。这些**水**滴会增长，直到被重力拉入一个紧凑的槽，然后进入一个水库。虽然收集器的大小不同，但是在一个相当雾霭的地区，一个40平方米的收集器每天可产生约200升的**水**，足够供应60个人的饮用**水**。

Modern atmospheric water harvesting follows many of the same principles. Instead of using leaves as condensation traps, however, which drip over an impractically large area, modern traps instead consist of sheets of very fine polymer mesh. As fog flows through the sheets, tiny droplets of water stick to the polymer fibres. These droplets grow until gravity pulls them into a compact trough and, thence, a reservoir. While collectors vary in size, a 40-metres-square collector in a reasonably foggy area yields around 200 litres a day, enough to supply 60 people with drinking water.

进一步的改进是可能的。由波兰克拉科夫AGH大学的乌尔修拉·斯塔赫维奇领导的团队发现，通过改变其聚合物纤维的制造方式，片可变得更加高效。斯塔赫维奇博士推测，通过一种称为静电纺丝的过程仔细制造，片可具有轻微的电荷，这对雾中的**水**滴有吸引力。在2021年进行的实验中，她和一组同事发现，这种片可以产生比以往多50%的**水**。

Further improvements are possible. A team led by Urszula Stachewicz at AGH University of Krakow in Poland found that the sheet could be made even more productive by changing the way in which its polymer threads were manufactured. Dr Stachewicz theorised that careful manufacture via a process known as electrospinning could lend the sheet a slight electrical charge that would prove attractive to water droplets in fog. In experiments conducted in 2021 she and a team of colleagues found that such sheets yielded 50% more water.

今年八月，她和纽约理工学院的博士生格雷戈里·帕里西报告称，通过添加二氧化钛（TiO2）到网格中，进一步提高了性能。先前的研究表明，二氧化钛在紫外光暴露后可以被制成极易吸水（强烈吸水）的材料——在极为雾天的情况下会有困扰，因为**水**会附着在网格上而不是滴入贮水池。然而，当雾较轻时，她和帕里西发现，加入TiO2的网格变得有效率提高了30%。她的雾收集器目前已经被用于三大洲的地点。

This past August, she and Gregory Parisi, a phd student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York reported yet further improvements by adding titanium dioxide (TiO2) to the mesh. Previous work had shown that titanium dioxide could be rendered superhydrophilic (intensely attractive to water) upon exposure to ultraviolet light—a hindrance under extremely foggy conditions, as water would stick to the mesh rather than trickle into the cistern. When fog was light, however, Dr Stachewicz and Mr Parisi found that a TiO2-enhanced mesh became 30% more effective. Her fog collectors are now being used at sites on three continents.

在内陆地区，雾**水**稀少，需要其他解决方案。一种有效的方法是利用空气中已有的**水**。当温度下降时，空气携带**水**的能力也会随之减少。这会导致多余的**水**凝结在表面上，这个过程通常被见于为露。这种情况在像英国这样水汽饱和的地方很常见，但是任何风小，平均相对湿度为70%或更高的地方都可以从空气中诱导**水**。

Further inland, where fog is scarce, other solutions are needed. One effective approach involves harnessing the water already present in the air. When the temperature drops, the water-carrying-capacity of air decreases with it. This leads to excess water condensing onto surfaces, a process most often seen as dew. It is common in water-saturated places like Britain, but anywhere with little wind and an average relative humidity of 70% or greater can cajole water out of the air.

这样做的一个关键方式是通过辐射冷却，即在晚上发生的现象，当某些材料（如铝）发射足够的热量，使其比周围环境的环境温度更低。日落后，**水**凝结在这些材料上，形成**水**滴并滴落。由这些辐射材料构建的腔体有时包括吸附内表面，空气中的**水**会粘附在那里。当潮湿的空气进入这样的腔体时，暴露在凉爽条件下后就会失去**水**，然后流出。一个巨大的好处是，这种技术在像沙漠这样日晴、白天温度高、夜晚凉爽的地方效果最好。

A key way to do this is with radiative cooling, a phenomenon that occurs at night when certain materials (like aluminium) radiate enough heat to cool below the ambient temperature of their surroundings. After sunset, water condenses on these materials, forms droplets and trickles off. Chambers built of these radiative materials sometimes include adsorbent inner surfaces to which water in the air readily sticks. When humid air drifts into such chambers, it loses its water upon exposure to the cool conditions before drifting out. One big benefit is that such techniques work best in places like deserts, with clear skies, high daytime temperatures and cool nights.

辐射冷却系统长期以来的一个重要局限是白天的相对无效性。这在2021年发生了变化，当时在苏黎世联邦理工学院，迪莫斯·普利卡科斯和当时的博士生伊万·哈奇勒制作了一块玻璃，底部覆盖一层银，顶部夹有一层硅聚合物，夹在两层铬之间。银层反射掉了进入的阳光，而夹层聚合物使得该装置在形成红外辐射的热量时可以散热。这使得玻璃的温度比周围环境温度低15°C，即使在白天的高温时期也能驱动凝结。配合隔热层，使用这种玻璃构建的冷凝腔每平方米每天可产生1.2升**水**。

An important limitation of radiative cooling has long been its relative ineffectiveness by day. That changed in 2021 when Dimos Poulikakos and his then-doctoral-student Iwan Haechler, at ETH Zurich, crafted a piece of glass with a layer of silver at the bottom and a layer of silicon polymer, sandwiched between layers of chromium, at the top. The silver layer reflected away the incoming sunlight while the sandwiched polymer allowed the device to shed heat in the form of infrared radiation. This cooled the glass by up to 15°C below ambient temperatures, driving condensation even during the heat of the day. Paired with a heat shield, a condensation chamber built with this glass helped produce 1.2 litres of water per square metre a day.

辐射冷却系统面临的另一个挑战是需要擦拭收集腔的表面的**水**。这需要能源，通常来自附近的涡轮机或太阳能电池板，这可能会很昂贵。为了降低成本，普利卡科斯博士和Haechler博士将一个超疏水涂层应用到腔体表面，迫使**水**滴离开表面，使得设备无需电力即可运行。

Another challenge posed by radiative cooling systems is that water needs to be wiped off the surface of the collection chambers. This requires power, typically from nearby turbines or solar panels, which can be expensive. To cut costs, Dr Poulikakos and Dr Haechler applied a superhydrophobic coating to the surface of the chamber, forcing water droplets off the surface and making it possible for the device to function without electricity.

这种技术确实是负担得起的，原型机本身成本不到50美元。但在很多急需水资源的地区，湿度太低，无法进行露水收集。在这些地方，最有希望的选择是利用超吸水材料。

Such technology is indeed affordable, with the prototype itself costing less than $50. But in many regions where water is desperately needed, humidity levels are too low for dew harvesting to be feasible. In places like these, the most promising options are those that make use of superabsorbent materials.

许多盐类，是熟悉的氯化钠的化学近亲，会迅速从空气中吸取**水**。考虑到这一点，沙特阿拉伯国王阿卜杜拉科学技术大学的一支工程团队，由彭旺带领，研究了使用装有氯化锂的中空纳米碳胶囊的效果。2020年，研究人员报告称，当相对湿度低于60%时，这些胶囊可以从环境空气中捕获超过其重量两倍的**水**蒸气。使用其他盐类的类似技术已被证明能够在10%的湿度环境中收集**水**。

Many salts, chemical cousins of the familiar sodium chloride, will readily snatch water out of the air. With this in mind, an engineering team led by Peng Wang at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia studied the effectiveness of hollow nanocarbon capsules filled with lithium chloride. In 2020 the researchers reported that these capsules could capture more than double their weight in water vapour from ambient air when relative humidity was below 60%. Similar techniques using other salts have proved capable of gathering water in humidity levels as low as 10%.

这些发现是有希望的，但该技术仍处于原型阶段之外。存在的问题是效率低下；即使王博士领先世界的胶囊在非常干旱的条件下每公斤氯化锂仅能产生1.6升**水**在10小时内。虽然好过没有，但对维持社区还是不够的。

The findings are promising, but the technology has yet to advance beyond the prototype stage. The problem is inefficiency; even Dr Wang’s world-leading capsules can only produce 1.6 litres of water per kilogram of lithium chloride over the course of ten hours in very arid conditions. Better than nothing, but inadequate for sustaining a community.

然而，这些技术共同展示了一个更加美好的未来是可能的。甚至自现代记录以来一直没有降雨的干旱地区，也有望有一天产生足够的**水**来维持定居点。并不只是在虚构的星球上。 ■

Between them, though, these technologies suggest a brighter future is possible. Areas so dry as to have gone without rainfall since modern records began may one day yield enough water to sustain settlement. And not just on a fictional planet. ■

一些拉布拉多犬易患肥胖症 (Some Labradors have a predisposition to obesity)
===========================================================

一种基因突变使狗的新陈代谢减缓，让它们总是饥饿。 (A gene mutation slows the dogs’ metabolism and makes them constantly hungry)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![一只拉布拉多犬从桶里吃东西](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240309_STP504.jpg)

就像他们的人类主人一样，**狗**正在经历肥胖症的流行。最近一项针对英国狗的研究发现，每14只狗中就有一只太胖了，使它们处于患关节炎等疾病的更高风险之中，缩短了它们的寿命，让散步变得更加困难。某些品种，如**拉布拉多犬**，特别容易发胖。纯种拉布拉多犬比混血杂种狗更容易超重，超重风险高出约70%。一项发表在《科学进展》杂志上的新研究发现了其原因之一——一个遗传异常导致部分拉布拉多犬容易肥胖。

Much like their human owners, dogs are experiencing an obesity epidemic. One recent study of British pooches found that one in 14 is too pudgy, putting them at higher risk of conditions like arthritis, shortening their lifespan and making walks more of a drag. Certain breeds, like Labradors, are particularly prone to fatness. Purebred Labs are around 70% more likely to be overweight than mixed-breed mutts. A new study, published in the journal *Science Advances*, has identified one reason why—a genetic quirk makes some Labradors prone to obesity.

由剑桥大学兽医遗传学家埃莉诺·拉凡领导的研究集中在一个名为POMC的基因上，该基因不仅存在于人类中，还存在于狗中。在2016年发表的一项早前研究中，拉凡博士及其同事发现，超重的拉布拉多犬比体型较瘦的狗更可能缺少该基因中的一个小片段DNA，即所谓的缺失突变。在最新的研究中，研究人员着手确定这种基因变体是如何导致拉布拉多犬增重的。

The study, led by Eleanor Raffan, a veterinary geneticist at the University of Cambridge, focused on a gene known as POMC, which is found in humans as well as dogs. In a previous study, published in 2016, Dr Raffan and her colleagues found that obese Labradors were much more likely than slimmer dogs to be missing a small section of DNA in the gene, a so-called deletion mutation. In the latest study the researchers set out to identify how this genetic variant, which is present in a quarter of Labs, might cause them to gain weight.

他们第一次发现，携带该突变的狗似乎比没有突变的狗更饥饿。这个结论基于一项“盒中香肠测试”的结果。实验者记录了拉布拉多犬对一块肉香四溢的零食反应，狗犬们可以看到也能闻到，却无法吃。平均而言，携带POMC突变的狗犬几乎会花上两倍的时间盯着、或者因为某种原因玩耍着引人入胜的盒子，而未携带突变的狗则没有这么做。

Their first finding was that dogs with the mutation seemed to be hungrier than dogs without it. This conclusion rested on the results of a “sausage-in-a-box test”. Experimenters recorded the Labs’ reaction to a meaty treat that they could see and smell, but couldn’t eat. On average, dogs with the POMC mutation spent almost twice as long looking at, or—for whatever reason—playing with, the tantalising box than did those without.

POMC 突变似乎增加了这些狗犬对食物的渴望，但并没有增加它们对食物的喜欢程度。如果狗犬的饲料抹上了酸橙汁，携带突变的狗和未携带突变的狗同样可能会对食物失去胃口。如果给狗犬们在一顿饭中无限制地吃东西的机会，他们之间也没有明显的暴饮暴食差异。作者们认为，携带该突变的拉布拉多犬可能更倾向于在餐间寻找食物，导致它们发胖。

The POMC mutation seemed to boost how much the dogs wanted food, but not how much they liked it. Dogs with and without the mutation were just as likely to be put off their kibble if it had been slathered with lime juice. If the dogs were given the chance to eat unlimited food in one sitting, there were also no clear differences in how much they binged. The authors suggested that Labs with the mutation may be more inclined to seek out food in between meals, causing them to put on the pounds.

这种突变不仅影响了狗犬对食物的渴望，而且减缓了它们的新陈代谢。在另一个实验中，狗犬被鼓励在一个呼吸舱内睡觉，该舱可测量吸入和呼出的氧气和二氧化碳的容积。科学家通过这个数据计算出，携带 POMC 突变的寻回犬在休息时燃烧的热量比没有突变的寻回犬少25%，表明这些食欲旺盛的狗犬可能需要坚持尽量节制的饮食才能保持苗条。

Not only did the mutation influence the dogs’ desire for food, it also slowed their metabolism. In another experiment the dogs were encouraged to sleep in a respiratory chamber, which measured the volume of oxygen and carbon dioxide breathed in and out. From this, the scientists calculated that Retrievers with the POMC mutation burned 25% fewer calories at rest than those without, indicating that the hungry dogs may need to stick to a particularly light diet in order to stay slim.

在狗犬的肥胖问题中可能还有许多其他因素。尽管对许多发福的品种进行了测试，但研究人员只在拉布拉多犬和弗拉特寻回犬中发现了 POMC 缺失。但是在这些狗犬中，这种突变可能是难以消除的，因为为了消除它需要大幅减少已经有限的基因库。科学家还怀疑这种变体可能使狗更容易训练——大约四分之三的拉布拉多导盲犬中都携带有这种突变。

Many other factors are likely to influence obesity in dogs. The authors have only found the POMC deletion in Labradors and Flat-Coated Retrievers, despite testing for it in many other portly breeds. But in these dogs the mutation is probably here to stay, as selective breeding to eliminate it would require a huge reduction in an already limited gene pool. The scientists also suspect that the variant may make dogs easier to train—it is present in around three-quarters of Labrador assistance dogs.

拉凡博士的研究还为人类POMC 突变的生物学提供了洞见。患有这些罕见突变的人报告极度饥饿，并且很多孩童便因此而肥胖。研究基因影响的科学家们通常会研究啮齿动物，但是对于 POMC，啮齿动物与其他哺乳动物之间存在重要差异。作者们发现了一个蛋白质，它受 POMC 突变的影响，而在老鼠中却不存在。他们认为这个被忽视的蛋白质很可能也参与了人类体重控制。

Dr Raffan’s work also provides insights into the biology of POMC mutations, which are relevant for humans too. People with these rare mutations report extreme hunger and many become obese as children. Scientists investigating the effects of genes typically study rats and mice, but in the case of POMC there are important differences between the genes of rodents and other mammals. The authors identified a protein which is affected by POMC mutation in the Labradors, but is not present in mice. They think this overlooked protein may well be involved in human weight control too.

针对人类中的 POMC 通路的药物已经问世。在2020年，一种模拟 POMC 产生的蛋白质之一的药物 setmelanotide 获得批准用于人类。目前尚不清楚它是否对狗有效，而且在英国每日价格至少为240英镑（在美国为330美元），即便是最宠爱的宠物也不太可能会被医生开处方。拉凡博士解释说：“有许多身体健康、快乐的拉布拉多犬携带有 POMC 突变。”目前，希望保持宠物苗条的主人们只需要隐藏零食，并抵制那些乞求的狗眼。■

Medication targeting the faulty POMC pathway in humans has already been developed. In 2020, setmelanotide, a drug that mimics one of the proteins produced by POMC, was approved for use in humans. It is unclear whether it would work in dogs, and with a price tag of at least £240 in Britain ($330 in America) per daily dose, it is unlikely to be prescribed to even the most pampered pets anytime soon. “There are many healthy, happy Labs who have a POMC mutation,” explained Dr Raffan. For now, owners looking to keep their pets in shape will just need to hide the treats and resist those pleading, puppy-dog eyes. ■

一个灵活的贴片可以帮助声音障碍患者说话 (A flexible patch could help people with voice disorders talk)
===============================================================================

它会将声带运动转化为声音。 (It would convert vocal-cord movements into sound)
-------------------------------------------------------------

![穿过声带的视角。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_STP501.jpg)

**人类**的**声音**，具有让观众入迷、迷倒爱人和惹恼邻居的强大力量，却是一种精妙的东西。当来自肺部的空气导致**声带**（喉咙中的肌肉褶皱）振动时，每个人独特的声音就被产生出来。这些**声带**很容易因压力、感染或过度使用而受损。患声音障碍的人不仅仅是过度热衷表演的人——根据2005年的一项研究，30%的人口在一生中某个时刻会经历声音障碍。

The human voice, with all its power to mesmerise audiences, woo loved ones and irritate neighbours, is a delicate thing. Each person’s distinctive sound is produced when air from the lungs causes the vocal cords, folds of muscle tissue in the larynx, to vibrate. These vocal cords can easily get damaged by stress, infections, or overuse. It is not just overzealous performers who are at risk of straining their voiceboxes—according to a 2005 study, 30% of the population will experience a voice disorder at some point in their life.

本周发表在《自然通讯》杂志上的一项研究中，加州大学洛杉矶分校的一组生物工程研究人员提出了一个吸引人的解决方案。他们设计并测试了一种软贴片，可以贴在一个人的颈部，它能够捕捉肌肉运动，并借助处理信号的机器学习算法将其转化为可听见的语音。

In a study published in the journal *Nature Communications* this week, a group of bioengineering researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, have put forward an attractive solution. They have designed and tested a soft patch that can be stuck onto a person’s neck, where it will pick up muscle movements and, with the help of machine-learning algorithms that process the signals, translate them into audible speech.

尽管团队的设备是早期原型，但它有可能在目前的替代方法上有重大改进。当一个人今天失声时，最简单的解决方案是通过打字、发短信或写字条进行交流。研究论文的第一作者陈俊表示，打字可能会很慢且不便，而只能在良好的光线下写出清晰的笔记。更复杂的解决方案，比如电喉仪，外部设备贴在喉咙上产生语音所需的振动，可能需要特殊培训才能使用，而手术干预常常令人望而生畏。贴片理论上能够克服所有这些障碍。

Even though the team’s device is an early prototype, it has the potential to offer a substantial improvement on current alternatives. When a person loses their voice today, the easiest fix is to resort to typing, texting, or writing notes to communicate. Typing can be slow and inconvenient, says Jun Chen, the paper’s lead author, and writing legible notes is only possible in good lighting. More sophisticated solutions such as electrolarynxes, external devices held against the throat to produce the vibrations necessary for speech, can require special training to use, and surgical interventions are often off-puttingly invasive. A patch would theoretically be able to clear all these hurdles.

陈博士的设备背后的原理是一种被称为磁弹性效应的原理。当磁性纳米粒子嵌入弹性或硅胶等软材料中时，它们的磁性能随着材料的拉伸而改变。这是因为每次变形都会导致粒子转动或相对移动，改变材料的磁化。当这些粒子嵌入一个带有铜线圈边缘的贴片中，生成背景磁场，粒子的运动可以准确地被记录为相对于这一背景的变化。


The mechanism behind Dr Chen’s device is a principle known as the magnetoelastic effect. When magnetic nanoparticles are embedded into soft materials like elastic or silicone polymers, their magnetic properties can change as the material is stretched. That’s because each deformation causes the particles either to rotate or move relative to one another, changing the magnetisation of the material. When embedded in a patch with a hem of copper coils generating a background magnetic field, the movements of the particles can be accurately captured as variations against this background.

当喉部肌肉在硅贴片下运动时，产生的磁场变化也可以转化为电信号。在对八名参与者进行的一项测试中，研究人员捕捉到了受试者说话和假装说话五个不同句子（包括：“希望你的实验进展顺利！”，“圣诞快乐！”和“我爱你！”）时产生的信号。然后，他们训练了一个机器学习模型来识别与每个句子相关的电信号的不同形状。然后，该算法能够以超过90%的准确率预测参与者说出哪个句子——无论是大声还是悄悄说话。

When the throat muscles move under the silicone patch, the resulting magnetic-field variations can also be converted into electrical signals. In a test with eight participants, the researchers captured the signals arising as the subjects spoke and lip-synched five different sentences (including: “Hope your experiments are going well!”, “Merry Christmas!” and “I love you!”). They then trained a machine-learning model to recognise the distinct shapes of the electrical signals associated with each sentence. This algorithm was then able to predict which of the five sentences the participants spoke—whether aloud or in silence—with more than 90% accuracy.

这种贴片的设计带来了额外的好处。除了具有可伸缩性，贴片在多汗的皮肤上依然粘附，并且连续使用40分钟不会发热。

The design of the patch brings additional benefits. In addition to stretchiness, the patch remains sticky on sweaty skin, and can be used continuously for 40 minutes without heating up.

还有很长的路要走。目前这个设备只能识别训练过的五个短语。此外，声带的个体差异意味着算法必须针对每个用户进行个性化。要使其在规模上实用化，研究人员将需要收集更多数据。 ■


There is a way to go yet. For now the device can only recognise the five phrases it was trained on. Plus, individual differences in vocal folds means the algorithm has to be personalised to each user. To make it practical at scale, the researchers will need to collect a lot more data. ■

![印度若奈普尔的拉杰玛哈尔精品酒店外停着一辆白色的宾利轿车](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_ASP001.jpg)

**整个印度**在二月转入三月之际，都被安南特·安巴尼在印度西部一个没有吸引力的工业城市贾姆纳加尔的婚前庆祝活动所吸引。安巴尼是印度首富、信实集团的老板 [穆凯什·安巴尼](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/05/18/mukesh-ambani-returns-to-the-spotlight)之子。比尔·盖茨、马克·扎克伯格和蕾哈娜出席了活动，还有大批印度商业大亨、板球传奇和宝莱坞一线明星。政府临时将当地的国内机场改建为国际机场。对数亿印度人而言，他们通过电视、社交媒体和报纸密切关注这场奢华活动，这些庆祝活动成为了印度富人品味和权力的简写。

ALL OF INDIA was transfixed, as February turned to March, by the spectacle of Anant Ambani’s pre-wedding celebrations in Jamnagar, an unlovely industrial town in western India. Mr Ambani is the son of [Mukesh Ambani](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/05/18/mukesh-ambani-returns-to-the-spotlight), India’s richest man and boss of Reliance, a giant conglomerate. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Rihanna turned up, as did hordes of Indian business tycoons, cricket legends and Bollywood A-listers. The government temporarily converted the local domestic airport into an international one. For hundreds of millions of Indians following the lavish proceedings on TV, social media and in the papers, the festivities stood as shorthand for the tastes and power of India’s rich.

安巴尼家族及其同行的富豪在印度是家喻户晓的名字。但他们并不代表印度的富人。亿万富翁几乎是一少数。根据榜单编制者 *福布斯*，印度只有186名亿万富翁。远比它们更具影响力、也更具代表性的是印度的百万美元富豪，他们的人数每年都在增加。相对于他们的人数，这些人在消费、投资和增长模式上具有过大的影响力。他们往往不会登上头条或炫耀他们的财富。

The Ambanis and their fellow plutocrats are household names in India. But they are not representative of India’s wealthy. Billionaires, almost by definition, are a select few. According to *Forbes*, a compiler of lists, there are just 186 of them in India. Far more consequential to—and representative of—[India’s economic story](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/15/how-strong-is-indias-economy-under-narendra-modi) are the legions of dollar millionaires, whose ranks are expanding year by year. They have an outsize influence, relative to their numbers, on patterns of consumption, investment and growth. They tend not to make headlines or advertise their wealth.

提供服务于这些富人的企业没有固定的“富有”定义。但一个被广泛接受的“高净值个人”的门槛是拥有100万美元或更多的净资产，包括主要住房的价值。这可能会通过计算那些靠继承获得孟买海滨大公寓的工资微薄的人来增加人数——在这座城市，100万美元可以购买1100平方英尺（100平方米）的黄金产权。但这并不考虑持有非法现金的人，也就没有反映真实数字。专家们估计，这些情况大致互相抵消，从而提供了一个国家富裕人群的合理画面。

There is no fixed definition of “rich” used by the businesses that cater to them. But one commonly accepted threshold for being a “high-net-worth individual” is possession of net assets of $1m or more, including the value of primary homes. That could inflate numbers by counting someone who works for a modest wage but inherits a large seafront flat in Mumbai—$1m buys 1,100 square feet (100 square metres) of prime property in the city. But it does not account for those who hold illicit cash, depressing the real figure. Experts assume that these things roughly cancel each other out to provide a decent picture of a country’s wealthy people.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_ASC750.png)

根据这一定义，据瑞士银行瑞士信贷的研究，印度在2022年大约有85万名百万美元富豪，比10年前增加了47.3万人。在2012年至2022年间，百万美元富翁的数量以每年8.5%的速度增长，超过了5.6%的平均国内生产总值增长率。现在经济复苏得更加强劲。因此，财富管理者预计，每年百万美元富豪的数量将增长15-20%。这些人是新富裕阶层。**没有**关于这群人口的人口统计数据。但从管理他们资金的人中可以得出一些普遍趋势。一个统一的主题浮出水面：印度的新富裕阶层与老富裕阶层有着天壤之别。

By that definition, India had around 850,000 dollar millionaires in 2022, a net addition of 473,000 from a decade earlier, according to research by Credit Suisse, a Swiss bank. Between 2012 and 2022 the number of dollar millionaires grew at an annual rate of 8.5%, outpacing average GDP growth of 5.6%. The economy is rebounding even more strongly now. As a result, wealth managers expect the number of dollar millionaires to expand by 15-20% per year. These are the new rich. No datasets exist delineating the demographics of this cohort. But it is possible to draw broad trends from the people who manage their money. One unifying theme emerges: India’s new rich are nothing like the old.

首先，他们更加分散。印度人不再需要生活在孟买、德里或班加罗尔这样的头号城市才能致富。科塔克马辛德拉大银行的财富管理主管贾德普·汉斯拉吉说，来自小城市的投资者激增是惊人的。他们来自“印多尔、博帕尔、勒克瑙或坎普尔。我是说...巴雷利。这完全令我困惑，”他说，指的是之前一代银行家会嗤之以鼻的这类城市。印度最大的银行之一印度房地产金融公司的拉克什·辛格表示，他看到来自阿萨姆邦乔尔哈特这样地方的几十万美元的投资，大多数印度人难以在地图上找到这个地方。

First, they are more spread out. No longer do Indians need to live in top-tier cities like Mumbai, Delhi or Bangalore to get loaded. Jaideep Hansraj, who ran wealth management for 15 years at Kotak Mahindra, a big bank, and now heads the securities business, says the surge in investors from small cities is phenomenal. They come from “Indore or Bhopal or Lucknow or Kanpur. I mean…Bareilly. It completely bamboozles me,” he says, referring to the sorts of cities an earlier generation of bankers would have sneered at. Rakesh Singh of HDFC, India’s biggest bank by market capitalisation, says he has seen half-million-dollar investments coming from places like Jorhat in [Assam](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/09/can-narendra-modi-complete-indias-state-building-project), which most Indians would struggle to locate on a map.

推动财富地理分散化的是印度日益改善的[基础设施](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/13/india-is-getting-an-eye-wateringly-big-transport-upgrade)。这降低了运输成本，加快了工业货物运输。这包括航空连通性的大幅扩张、高速互联网的普及以及各邦政府为获取印度不断增长的经济蛋糕而提供的投资激励。财富管理账户也在扩大他们的业务以为客户提供服务。

Driving this geographic diversification of wealth is India’s improving [infrastructure](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/13/india-is-getting-an-eye-wateringly-big-transport-upgrade). This has lowered transport costs and sped up industrial shipments. It includes a big expansion in air connectivity, the spread of high-speed internet, and investment incentives from state governments keen to grab a piece of India’s growing economy. Wealth managers, too, are expanding their operations to serve customers where they are.

第二个变化是在富人的平均年龄上。印度的富人可能曾经有着50岁以上的中位数年龄，现在40多岁和30多岁的百万富翁很常见。一些人受益于政府用于基础设施项目的征地，从先前没有效益的土地上获得了大笔款项。许多人是制造消费品，如威化饼干（是土豆而不是硅）、服装或印度薄饼，或者是成长中的经济所需的不起眼但不可或缺的产品，比如钢筋或滚珠。很大一部分是拥有公司股票期权或谨慎的个人投资的薪酬专业人士。这些是具有“坚实中产阶级价值观”的第一代富豪，安纳德·拉希财富（管理着为近万名客户管理66亿美元资金）的切坦·谢劳伊表示。

A second change is in the average age of the wealthy. Where India’s rich might once have had a median age above 50, now 40- and 30-something millionaires are common. Some have benefited from government land acquisition for infrastructure projects, reaping big sums from previously unproductive holdings. Many are first-generation businessmen making consumer staples such as wafers (potatoes, not silicon), clothes or poppadoms, or unsexy but essential goods necessary for a growing economy, such as rebar or ball bearings. A huge chunk are salaried professionals with company stock options or prudent personal investments. These are first-generation millionaires with “strong middle-class values”, says Chethan Shenoy of Anand Rathi Wealth, which manages $6.6bn for nearly 10,000 clients.

第三个主要转变在于新富人在投资和消费方面所作的财富运用。他们对资本市场比他们的父母更加熟悉。“以前，我可以和90%的客户进行一次标准对话，”国际银行渣打银行的财富管理主管尼廷·陈加帕说。“今天‘多样化’才是关键。不仅仅是共同基金，还有私募股权、社会事业、风险投资，我可以在上市公司中做什么，我可以在非上市公司中做什么？”富人们仍然购买大量金饰和第二套住房，在印度及国外。但他们对市场的兴趣和对风险的胃口也有所增加。

The third major shift is in what the new rich do with their riches, in terms of both investment and consumption. They are much more comfortable with capital markets than their parents were. “Earlier I could go and have one standard conversation with 90% of my clients,” says Nitin Chengappa, who heads private banking at Standard Chartered, an international bank. Today “diversification is the key. It’s not just mutual funds. It’s private equity, social causes, venture capital, what can I do in listed [companies], what can I do in non-listed?” The rich still buy plenty of gold and second homes, in India and abroad. But their interest in markets and their appetite for risk have increased, too.

这并不意味着他们回避消费。出国度假是一种普遍享受，奢华婚礼和豪华汽车也是如此（梅赛德斯-奔驰预计印度将在三年内成为其在德国之外的第三大市场，而不仅仅是第五大市场）。欧洲奢侈品牌和酒店在印度城市中越来越常见。去年，迪奥在孟买举办了一场时装秀，2022年瑞士钟表业对印度的出口创下了历史新高。大型印度企业塔塔的奢侈品和五星级酒店业务表现强劲，尤其是来自小城市的需求。据报道，该公司计划在今年开业25家酒店，其中许多是高端酒店。孟买明年即将开业的国际机场将有五分之一的停车位为私人飞机保留。

That does not mean they shy away from consumption. Foreign holidays are a common indulgence, as are extravagant weddings and fancy cars. (Mercedes-Benz expects India to become its third-biggest market outside Germany in three years, up from fifth.) European luxury brands and hotels are an increasingly common sight in India’s cities. Last year Dior held a show in Mumbai, and in 2022 the Swiss watch industry enjoyed a record year for exports to India. Tata, a big Indian conglomerate, has seen robust growth in its luxury-goods and five-star hotel businesses, especially from smaller cities. It is planning to open 25 hotels this year, many of them high-end. An international airport due to open in Mumbai next year will have a fifth of its parking spots reserved for private jets.

印度新兴富裕阶层的增长面临两个风险。第一个是政治、监管或税收变革。投资风险承担和自由消费行为取决于富人有信心认为自己只会变得更富。政治不稳定可能引发投资者撤退到较为安全的投资方式，并减少支出。尽管他们大多数情况下不受国内通货膨胀的影响，但他们对税收变化（尤其是对收入和奢侈支出的税收）尤为敏感。

Two risks could stall the growth of India’s new class of wealthy. The first is political, regulatory or tax changes. Risk-taking in investment and free-spending consumption are driven by confidence among the rich that they will only get richer. Political instability could prompt a retreat to safer investments and lower spending. And although they are mostly immune to domestic inflation they are particularly sensitive to changes in taxation, especially on income and luxury spending.

另一个风险是富人可能会逃离。高端移民公司亨利与合伙人估计，2022年有7500名印度百万富翁移居国外。更多人悄悄在迪拜、伦敦或新加坡拥有第二套房产，并有移居那些地方的权利来保持他们的选择。大多数人希望将子女送到国外大学。在国际公司工作的专业人士也具有很高的流动性，他们受到更高生活质量、更好的子女教育和[更干净的环境](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/13/india-and-pakistan-are-choking-on-each-others-pollution)的诱惑。

The other risk is that the rich might flee. Henley and Partners, a high-end immigration firm, reckons that 7,500 Indian millionaires moved abroad in 2022. Many more have quietly acquired second homes in Dubai, London or Singapore, as well as the right to move there as a way of keeping their options open. Most hope to send their children to foreign universities. Professionals with international firms are also highly mobile, tempted by higher quality of life, better schooling for their children and a [cleaner environment](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/13/india-and-pakistan-are-choking-on-each-others-pollution).

印度的新富豪与之前的精英一样，是一个爱国的群体。许多人热衷于回馈和帮助改善其他印度人的生活，同时也享受生活。但即使他们在改变，他们也希望看到印度发生变化。正如一位银行家所说，“不论你有多富有，也无法改变污染。”■

India’s new rich, like the previous elite, are a patriotic group. Many are keen to give back and help improve the lives of other Indians—while also having a good time. But even as they change, they would like India to change too. As one banker puts it, “As rich as you get you cannot do anything about the pollution.” ■

印度政府实施具争议性的公民法 (India’s government implements a controversial citizenship law)
===========================================================================

在大选前不久可能正试图讨好其支持者。 (It may be trying to please its base shortly before a general election)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![印度诺伊达的穆斯林信徒在斋月的第一天做礼拜](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_ASP003.jpg)

纳伦德拉·莫迪以办成事情而自豪。然而，在实施《公民身份修正法案》（CAA）时，这一印度人民党（BJP）的竞选承诺，他的政府拖拖拉拉。这项法律规定，被一些邻国迫害的宗教少数群体能够通过加速方式获得印度公民身份。这些规定于3月11日发布，距它通过议会已有四年之久。

Narendra Modi prides himself on getting things done. Yet when it came to implementing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), a campaign pledge of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), his government dragged its feet. The rules for implementing the law, which offers persecuted religious minorities from some neighbouring countries an accelerated route to Indian citizenship, were published on March 11th, four years after it passed parliament.

这项法律备受争议，因为其不包括**穆斯林**。政府表示，这是因为他们在相关国家中并非少数群体。然而，一些印度**穆斯林**担心这项法律最终可能被用来挑战他们自己的公民身份。它排除**穆斯林**的做法确实使其在BJP的印度教民族主义支持者中颇受欢迎。有人怀疑其实施时间是为了在预定于5月举行的大选之前激励印度教选民。

The law is controversial because it does not include Muslims. The government says that is because they are not a minority in any of the relevant countries. Yet some Indian Muslims worry the law could end up being used to challenge their own citizenship. Its exclusion of Muslims has certainly made it popular with the BJP’s Hindu-nationalist base. There is a suspicion its implementation was timed to rally Hindu voters ahead of a general election due by May.

该法案允许孟加拉国、巴基斯坦和阿富汗的难民申请，只要他们是印度教徒、锡克教徒、佛教徒、耆那教徒、祆教徒或基督徒，并在2014年底之前抵达印度。在印度内部，批评者对CAA提出质疑，认为它明确将公民身份与宗教联系起来，这违反了印度的世俗宪法。人们担心它可能针对印度**穆斯林**，这种担忧被另一个因悬而未决的方案加剧，该方案旨在迫使印度人证明自己的公民身份以便被纳入国家登记。政府否认这项法律是歧视性的。

The act allows for applications by refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, as long as they are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians and arrived in India before the end of 2014. Within India, critics have challenged the CAA for explicitly linking citizenship and religion, which they say violates India’s secular constitution. The fear that it could be used against Indian Muslims was exacerbated by another scheme, since suspended, to compel Indians to prove their citizenship in order to be included in a national register. The government denies that the law is discriminatory.

反对派怀疑公告的时机。一位国大党发言人称，这是为了分散人们对同一天早些时候最高法院裁决的注意力，该裁决驳回了印度国家银行请求延长关于捐助者的详情的时间，这是BJP设计的具有争议性的竞选融资计划。此外，此次公告还紧随一名选举委员突然辞职之后，前几天预计选举日期将公布。到目前为止，CAA的重新讨论已使这些故事黯然失色。■

The opposition suspects the timing of the announcement. A Congress party spokesman said it was designed to distract from a Supreme Court ruling, earlier the same day, which rejected a plea by the State Bank of India to be given more time to publish details about donors in a controversial BJP-designed campaign-finance scheme. It also followed the sudden resignation of an election commissioner over the weekend, days before the election date was expected to be announced. So far, the renewed debate over the CAA has taken oxygen away from these stories.■



<hr><span style="color: red;"><b>亚洲 | 九头蛇般的核导弹</b></span> (Asia | Hydra-headed nukes)

印度正升级其核导弹 (India is souping up its nuclear missiles)
=================================================

首次测试了一种可以分别打击不同目标的多弹头导弹。 (For the first time it has tested a missile with multiple warheads that can each hit different targets)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![一枚“阿格尼-V”弹道导弹在德里巡游。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_ASP504.jpg)

在孟加拉湾的一座印度领土——阿卜杜勒・卡拉姆岛上，对于一位无所事事的旁观者而言，3月11日射入天空的导弹与自20世纪80年代以来在那里发射的许多类似导弹没有太大区别。更具洞察力的旁观者可能会注意到这是“阿格尼-V”导弹的第十次试验，这是印度的第一种洲际弹道导弹（ICBM），可达到中国的任何地区。但即使是最熟练的导弹观察者也不会知道这次发射的重要性，因为它隐藏在弹头内部。

To an idle observer on Abdul Kalam Island, an Indian territory in the Bay of Bengal, the missile that shot into the sky on March 11th was little different from scores of similar launches that have occurred there since the 1980s. A more discerning bystander might have noted that it was the tenth test of the Agni V, India’s first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), capable of reaching any part of China. But even the most astute missile-watcher would not have known the significance of the launch, which lay inside the nose cone.

据信，本月的发射是印度首次测试配备多弹头独立目标再入装置（MIRV）的导弹，MIRV最早由美国在1960年代开发。这些是小型弹头，挤在单枚导弹的顶部，每个弹头都可以打击相距数百公里的目标。在美国科学家研究团队——美国科学家联合会的专家Hans Kristensen和Matt Korda写道，这次试验是印度科学家的技术成就。“这标志着印度核姿态的重大发展，比我们几年前预想的要快”，他们认为，这也可能会影响亚洲的核力学。

This month’s launch is thought to be the first time that India has tested a missile with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles, known as MIRVs, first developed by America in the 1960s. These are small warheads, crammed atop a single missile, each capable of striking targets hundreds of kilometres apart from one another. The test is a technological triumph for Indian scientists. It “marks a significant development for India’s nuclear posture, and faster than we anticipated just a few years ago”, write Hans Kristensen and Matt Korda, experts at the Federation of American Scientists, a research group. It could also affect nuclear dynamics in Asia.

对于印度，MIRV具有三个优势。首先，它们让该国更有把握地确保其核弹头可以穿透任何未来的中国导弹防御系统。其次，即使中国（或者更少可能的巴基斯坦）突然摧毁印度导弹的一部分，少数幸存的导弹仍具有足够的火力，能够造成毁灭性的回击。

MIRVs have three advantages for India. One is that they give the country greater assurance that its nuclear warheads would get through any future Chinese missile-defence system. Another is that, even if China (or, less likely, Pakistan) were to destroy a portion of India’s missiles in a bolt from the blue, a small number of surviving missiles would still carry enough firepower to inflict existential damage in return.

第三，MIRV让印度可以以精度换取火力。据认为，印度1998年的氢弹试验失败了。MIRV让其可以使用更多数量的较弱的裂变弹头，以达到一个大型氢弹的效果。纽约奥尔巴尼大学的克里斯托弗・克拉里表示，“导弹，尤其是远程导弹，通常要比弹头贵得多，因此对于相同数量的目标弹头，成本节约可能会相当可观。”这将吸引印度：其国防开支远远低于中国。

The third is that MIRVs allow India to substitute accuracy for firepower. The country’s test of a thermonuclear bomb in 1998 is thought to have failed. MIRVs allow it to use a larger number of less powerful fission bombs to deliver the same effect as one large H-bomb. And there is another upside, says Christopher Clary of the University at Albany in New York. “Missiles, especially long-range ones, typically cost quite a bit more than warheads,” he says. “So the cost saving for an equal number of warheads on target could be substantial.” That will appeal to India: its defence spending is vastly lower than China’s.

所有这些都有缺点。MIRV使得更容易发动袭击对敌方核力量进行“缴械”第一打击。相反，将许多弹头装入单一导弹，也会成为敌方首次攻击的吸引目标。这可能会鼓励各国建立更大的武器库，并在危机中更快地发射。当美国和苏联在1970年代开始将导弹多弹头化时，这项技术导致了军备竞赛。

All this has drawbacks. MIRVs make it easier to launch a “disarming” first strike against an enemy’s nuclear forces. Conversely, in stuffing many warheads into a single missile, they are also attractive targets for an enemy’s first strike. That can encourage countries to build larger arsenals, and to launch them more quickly in a crisis. When America and the ussr began MIRVing their missiles in the 1970s, the technology contributed to an arms race.

华盛顿智库卡内基国际和平基金会的专家阿什利・泰利斯认为，印度几乎没有兴趣利用MIRV瞄准中国或巴基斯坦的核导弹，这种做法被称为“反制力量”。他指出，印度的导弹可能根本不够准确。印度需要进行更多的测试，以确保其MIRV能力。

Ashley Tellis, an expert at the Carnegie Endowment, a think-tank in Washington, has argued that India has little interest in using MIRVs for targeting Chinese or Pakistani nuclear missiles, a practice known as “counterforce”. Its missiles are probably not accurate enough for that anyway, he notes. India will need many more tests to have confidence in its MIRV capability.

尽管如此，克里斯汀森和科尔达仍心怀忧虑。他们指出，中国在一些导弹上部署了MIRV，而巴基斯坦在2017年进行了测试。在美国和俄罗斯，有讨论将原本单一弹头的导弹重新配备多弹头。他们总结道，“在这个几乎所有核武装国家都部署重要MIRV能力的世界中，看起来更加危险。” ■

Nonetheless, Mr Kristensen and Mr Korda are concerned. China has deployed MIRVs on some missiles, they point out, while Pakistan tested them in 2017. In America and Russia, there is talk of re-MIRVing missiles that were downgraded to single warheads. “A world in which nearly all nuclear-armed countries deploy significant MIRV capability”, they conclude, “looks far more dangerous.” ■

澳大利亚间谍头目引发了关于中国的辩论 (An Australian spy chief triggers a debate about China)
=======================================================================

其情报机构担心满足感 (Its intelligence agencies are concerned about complacency)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

![Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Director General Mike Burgess at a media briefing in Canberra](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_ASP002.jpg)

上个月，澳大利亚首席国内**间谍**迈克·伯吉斯在一次媒体简报会上在堪培拉引起轰动，当他宣称一位前澳大利亚政治家已被外国**间谍**团伙招募，并“出卖了自己的国家”。后来发现该团伙是中国团伙，该政治家的身份至今未公开。这一声明引发了激烈的猜测，讨论迈克·伯吉斯是否在煽动**偏执狂**。3月5日，前工党总理保罗·基廷表示，澳大利亚情报机构“将尽一切努力破坏与中国的任何有意义的和解”。

Last month Mike Burgess, Australia’s chief domestic spook, sent shockwaves through Canberra when he declared that a former Australian politician had been recruited by a foreign spy ring and “sold out their country”. The ring was later revealed to be Chinese. The politician remains unnamed. The claim triggered fierce speculation, and a debate about whether Mr Burgess was stoking paranoia. Australian intelligence agencies “will do anything to destabilise any meaningful rapprochement” with China, said Paul Keating, a former Labor prime minister, on March 5th.

迈克·伯吉斯很少保留自己的观点。自2020年以来，他在澳大利亚安全情报组织(ASIO)的演讲中一直警告类似的威胁。他经常提及外国干预。去年，在“五眼联盟”首次公开会议上，由美国、澳大利亚、英国、加拿大和新西兰组成的情报分享组织，他表示，“中国政府正在进行人类历史上持续时间最长…最复杂的知识产权和人才**窃取**”。

Mr Burgess rarely pulls his punches. He has warned of similar threats in speeches for his Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) since 2020. He often flags foreign meddling. Last year at the first public meeting of the Five Eyes, an intelligence-sharing group of America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand, he said that “the Chinese government is engaged in the most sustained...and sophisticated theft of intellectual property and expertise in human history.”

根据伯吉斯先生的说法，上个月解密信息有两个主要目标。第一个是教育澳大利亚人意识到**间谍**和外国干预的日益加剧的威胁(即外国政府秘密影响人员和政治)。第二是向中国传递信息:“我们希望A团队的头目知道他们的身份已暴露，”他说。在其背后可能是对中国过于自满的担忧。

Declassifying the information last month served two main goals, according to Mr Burgess. The first was to educate Australians about the growing threat of both espionage and foreign interference (which involves a foreign government secretly influencing people and politics). The second was to send a message to China: “We want the A-team’s bosses to know its cover is blown,” he said. Underlying that may be a concern about complacency over China.

自2022年澳大利亚选出由安东尼·阿尔班尼斯领导的工党政府以来，双边关系有所改善。阿尔班尼斯政府没有向中国做出重大让步，支持美英澳澳大利亚海军潜艇建造协议(AUKUS)。但是，它避免公开指责中国。因此，中国解除了2020年对澳大利亚大部分商品的贸易限制，并可能很快取消对葡萄酒的关税(见中国部分)。出口额从2020年的1470亿澳元（970亿美元）增至2023年的2000亿美元以上。大多数战略家认为这是一个好消息。但是堪培拉澳大利亚国立大学的罗里·梅德卡夫表示，“政府言行之间的**差距**很大且正在增大”。

Since Australians elected a Labor government, led by Anthony Albanese, in 2022 the bilateral relationship has improved. Mr Albanese’s government has not made major concessions to China and backs AUKUS, a submarine-building pact with America and Britain. However, it avoids calling out China publicly. As a result, China has lifted most of the trade restrictions it imposed on Australia in 2020, and may lift tariffs on wine shortly (see China section). Exports have boomed from A$147bn ($97bn) in 2020 to over $200bn in 2023. Most strategists agree that this is good news. But the “gap between what the government says and what it knows is big and getting bigger,” says Rory Medcalf at the Australian National University in Canberra.

一些情报官员担心，澳大利亚人可能会错过这种微妙之处，而“稳定”的关系可能被视为中国威胁正在减弱的迹象。澳大利亚思想研究所的一项民意调查显示，2022年认为中国“更多是安全威胁而不是经济伙伴”的澳大利亚人比例从63%下降到去年的52%。

Some intelligence officials worry that Australians may miss the nuance, and that a “stabilised” relationship might be taken as a sign that the Chinese threat is abating. The share of Australians who say China is “more of a security threat than an economic partner” fell from 63% in 2022 to 52% last year, according to polling from the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney.

另一方面，澳大利亚政府受到一小部分工党前政治家的抨击。他们批评基廷先生所称的澳大利亚“无脑亲美立场”，并指责情报头目对中国大肆宣扬。在去年12月，前工党外交部长盖瑞·埃文斯写道，历届政府“在安全政策制定上几乎放任国防和情报领域的强硬派”。

On the other side, the government is under fire from a small but vocal group of former Labor politicians. They are critical of what Mr Keating calls Australia’s “mindless pro-American stance” and accuse intelligence heads of tub-thumping over China. Successive governments have given “free rein in security policymaking to hardliners in the defence and intelligence community”, wrote Gareth Evans, a former Labor foreign minister, in December.

然而，根据安全情报组织(ASIO)官方历史的作者约翰·布莱克斯兰德，“外国干预的威胁是真实存在的”。中国长期以来一直在与澳大利亚政客建立影响力。ASIO现在表示，“A团队”正通过网上与有影响力的澳大利亚人进行培养，并提供“咨询”工作。根据伯吉斯的说法，一家未透露名称的“国家”正在利用“一流的**间谍**技术”来探查关键基础设施网络的弱点。与此同时，他的工作将变得越来越困难。根据AUKUS计划，美国将与澳大利亚分享珍贵的核推进技术。外国特工已经开始搜集信息。 ■

However, according to John Blaxland, the author of an official history of ASIO, “the threat of foreign interference is real.” China has long courted influence with Australian politicians. ASIO now says that the “A-team” is grooming well-connected Australians online, with offers of “consulting” jobs. An unnamed “nation-state” is using “top-notch tradecraft” to probe critical infrastructure networks for weakness, according to Mr Burgess. Meanwhile, his job will only become harder. Australia’s role in the Indo-Pacific power contest makes it a target. Under AUKUS, America will be sharing prized nuclear-propulsion technology with it. Foreign agents are already probing for information. ■

巴基斯坦的将军们显得越来越绝望 (Pakistan’s generals look increasingly desperate)
==============================================================

欺诈选举可能阻挡不了伊姆兰·汗的支持者 (A fraudulent election may not keep Imran Khan’s fans at bay)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![插图：一张选票被撕碎的图片](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_ASD001.jpg)

纳瓦兹·谢里夫（Nawaz Sharif）的巴基斯坦穆斯林联盟党（PML-N）重新掌权了。上个月的选举之后，这位三度任职的前总理的弟弟沙巴兹被安插到了统治岗位上。他的女儿玛丽亚姆则成为了人口众多的旁遮普省省长。那么为什么谢里夫如此郁闷呢？这位74岁的“旁遮普之狮”自投票以来就很少公开发表言论。据说他躲在拉合尔郊外的豪宅里，情绪低落。

Nawaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League party (PML-N) is back in power. Following elections last month, the thrice former prime minister’s younger brother, Shehbaz, has been installed in the ruling post. His daughter, Maryam, is the new chief minister of populous Punjab. So why is Mr Sharif so glum? The 74-year-old “lion of Punjab” has said little publicly since the vote. Bunkered down in his mansion outside Lahore, he is said to be depressed.

他有理由感到沮丧。PML-N的成功远不及谢里夫去年回国时所承诺的。他在伦敦流亡四年，是因为巴基斯坦的将军们——其民主的舞台管理者们——反对他。他们在2018年的选举中操纵以支持他的主要竞争对手伊姆兰·汗。但后来，他们与汗失和，又转向支持谢里夫。这位前板球顶级明星，现在因贪污指控而入狱。他的巴基斯坦正义运动党（PTI）已经被解体。因此，人们本以为PML-N将横扫选举，谢里夫将第四次当选总理。然而，发生了前所未有的事情。

He has reason to be. The PML-N’s success is much less than Mr Sharif was promised when he returned home last year. He had spent four years in exile in London because Pakistan’s generals—stage managers of its democracy—were against him. They rigged an election in 2018 in favour of his main rival, Imran Khan. But then they fell out with Mr Khan and reverted to the lion. A former cricketing god, Mr Khan is now in jail on graft charges. His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has been dismantled. PML-N was therefore expected to sweep the election and Mr Sharif to become prime minister for a fourth time. Instead, something unprecedented happened.

尽管军方想尽办法阻止巴基斯坦人为汗投票，但似乎大部分人还是这样做了。以独立候选人身份参选的与汗党有联系的候选人横扫全国。早期计票结果显示，他们有望赢得旁遮普省三分之二的席位以及整体多数席位。此时，军队干预达到了一个让一个小丑独裁者感到羞愧的程度。

Despite the army’s myriad ploys to prevent Pakistanis voting for Mr Khan, it seems most did so. Standing as independents, candidates linked to his party swept the country. Early counting put them on track for two-thirds of Punjab’s seats and an overall majority. At which point the army intervened to a degree that might make a tin-pot tyrant blush.

据称，军方特工被派往计票站，带来了替代的计票结果。在拉合尔以一个事实上的PTI候选人身份参选的最高法院律师萨尔曼·阿克拉姆·拉贾（Salman Akram Raja）被告知，他获得了95,000张选票的胜利。然后——哎呀——他却输给了PML-N候选人13,500张选票。谢里夫的政党否则将面临灭亡。实际上，他们只赢得了264个席位中的75个。他们通过与另一个日益式微的王朝，布托王朝运营的巴基斯坦人民党达成协议，凑成了多数席位。

Army agents were allegedly sent into counting stations with alternative tallies. Salman Akram Raja, a Supreme Court lawyer running as a de facto PTI candidate in Lahore, had been informed that he had won by 95,000 votes. And then—whoops—that he had lost to the PML-N candidate by 13,500. Mr Sharif’s party would otherwise have faced oblivion. As it is, it won only 75 of 264 seats. It cobbled together a majority by striking a deal with the Pakistan Peoples Party, which is run by another fading dynasty, the Bhuttos.

这种情况可能看起来像是巴基斯坦的老生常谈。该国在其历史上一直被军队直接或在不同程度上统治。在谢里夫经历过好几次的循环中，将军们将一个顺从的文职人士推上权力之位，然后，在他或她敢于独立行动后，换成另一位代理人或军事统治。于是，巴基斯坦经历了四位军事独裁者，而其20位文职总理中没有一位能完成五年任期。这解释了为什么它的治理如此糟糕。巴基斯坦的文职政府由于较少可能完成任期，就放弃了长期决策，而倾向于进行民粹主义的送礼和贪污。仅在2006年，巴基斯坦人比印度人更富裕；如今，印度的人均收入比巴基斯坦高出60%。

This might seem like Pakistani business as usual. The country has been ruled by the army, directly or at varying degrees of remove, throughout its history. In a cycle that Mr Sharif has been through several times, the generals put a biddable civilian in power then, after he or she dares to act independently, switch to a different proxy or army rule. Thereby Pakistan has had four army dictators and none of its 20 civilian prime ministers has completed a five-year term. This helps explain why it is so badly governed. Having little prospect of a full term, Pakistan’s civilian regimes abjure long-term decision-making in favour of populist giveaways and graft. As recently as 2006, Pakistanis were better-off than Indians; now the average income in India is 60% higher than that in Pakistan.

这次事态的重要问题之一是，军队是否能够保持控制。有两个原因让人认为这可能会很困难。首先是汗。或许是出于无意识的，鉴于他以往对军队的顺从，他已经引导巴基斯坦人长期以来的失望情绪转变为对军事机构的愤怒。这让巴基斯坦政治进入了新的领域。倘若军队参谋长阿西姆·穆尼尔将军在选举计票后宣布进入紧急状态，如同以前的前任可能会做的，他就将冒着引发一场起义的危险。“人们有这种感觉，应该停止这种类似肉汤的生活，”Banyan的一位老熟人拉贾说。“我们不能永远受两个与权力合作的家族统治。”

A big question arising from this latest turn of the wheel is whether the army can maintain control. There are two reasons to think it could struggle. The first is Mr Khan. Perhaps unwittingly, given his erstwhile compliance with the army, he has channelled Pakistanis’ long-standing despond into anger at the military establishment. This has put Pakistani politics on new terrain. Had the army chief, General Asim Munir, responded to the vote count by calling a state of emergency, as his predecessors might have, he would have risked an uprising. “There is this sense that the gravy train needs to stop,” says Mr Raja, an old acquaintance of Banyan. “We can’t be forever governed by two families in cahoots with the powers that be.”

危及现状的第二个因素是一场持久的经济危机。许多国家经历的通货膨胀冲击在巴基斯坦与长期存在的恶政治团团伙相结合，导致了持续的通货膨胀、失业和支付平衡问题。2022年汗被罢黜现在对他来说似乎是时机恰到好处。谢里夫决定让沙巴兹领导一个长达16个月的过渡政府，而不是提前举行选举，看起来是个重大失误。这使得危机沦为他的政党颈部上的绞索。因为巴基斯坦第24次国际货币基金组织的援助即将于本月到期，迫切需要一笔更大额的贷款，新政府将需要采取措施，这将使其变得比现在更不受欢迎。它的前景以及谢里夫重建其政党的希望看起来都很暗淡。

The second factor endangering the status quo is a protracted economic crisis. The inflationary shocks experienced in many countries have in Pakistan combined with the effects of long-standing malgovernance to deliver chronic inflation, joblessness and balance-of-payment problems. Mr Khan’s ousting in 2022 now appears well timed for him. Mr Sharif’s decision to let Shehbaz lead an 16-month-long replacement government instead of calling early elections looks like a major blunder. It has hung the crisis around his party’s neck. With Pakistan’s 24th IMF bail-out set to expire this month, and a bigger loan urgently required, the new government will need to take measures that will make it even more unpopular than it is. Its prospects—and Mr Sharif’s hopes of rebuilding his party—appear dire.

对于谢里夫不情愿重新加入的由军方主导的机构来说，情况可能也是如此。他们也许逃脱了最近的选举舞弊。但在这个过程中，汗的支持者让军队看起来显得不自信和脆弱。■

The same could be true for the army-run establishment that Mr Sharif has unhappily rejoined. It may have got away with its latest election heist. But in the process Mr Khan’s supporters have made the army look desperate and vulnerable. ■

为什么写一本关于科技世界的好书如此困难？ (Why is it so hard to write a good book about the tech world?)

当人们询问前记者、知名科技投资者迈克尔·莫里茨应该读哪本书才能了解硅谷时，他总是推荐两本。“它们不是关于硅谷的，但却与硅谷有着千丝万缕的联系，”他说。

WHEN PEOPLE ask Michael Moritz, a former journalist and prominent tech investor, what book they should read to understand Silicon Valley, he always recommends two. “They are not about Silicon Valley, but they have everything to do with Silicon Valley,” he says.

一本是约翰·格雷戈里·邓恩于1969年著作的《电影制片厂》，描写了这位美国作家在20世纪福斯度过的一年，亲眼目睹了电影的制作过程，以及高管们如何在创意和追求利润之间取得平衡。另一本是安迪·格罗夫于2001年著作的《泳过去》，他是芯片制造商英特尔的前老板，这部回忆录讲述了在大屠杀中生存的经历，展示了逆境如何孕育出每个创业者都需要的坚韧。

One is “The Studio” (1969) by John Gregory Dunne, an American writer who spent a year inside 20th Century Fox watching films get made and executives try to balance creativity with profit-seeking. The other, “Swimming Across” (2001) by Andy Grove, a former boss of Intel, a chipmaker, is a memoir about surviving the Holocaust. It shows how adversity can engender grit, which every entrepreneur needs.

莫里茨爵士之所以没有推荐一本**关于科技行业的书**，说出了一切。硅谷孵化了一些世界上最庞大的公司，但却没有激发出许多保持长期流行的书籍。相比之下，华尔街却拥有一部小众但历久弥新的经典著作，从“不可忽视的崩溃”(Too Big to Fail)，到公司贪婪(“大门外的野蛮人”)再到一部虚构作品《“欲望都市之火”](https://www.economist.com/1843/2012/09/14/what-makes-tom-wolfes-writing-so-good)》，该作品推广了“世界的主宰”这个术语。

That Sir Michael does not suggest [a book squarely about the tech business](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/06/09/the-five-best-books-for-understanding-silicon-valleys-history) says a lot. Silicon Valley has produced some of the world’s most gargantuan companies, but it has not inspired many written accounts with a long shelf life. Wall Street, by contrast, claims a small canon that has stood the test of time, from chronicles of meltdowns (“Too Big to Fail”), to corporate greed (“Barbarians at the Gate”) to a fictionalised account ([“The Bonfire of the Vanities”](https://www.economist.com/1843/2012/09/14/what-makes-tom-wolfes-writing-so-good)) that popularised the term “masters of the universe”.

为什么没有硅谷的主宰们呢？问题之一是访问权限，这在描写有权势的人时经常出现。科技高管们可能在“燃烧人”节(即燃烧人节)上放下了防备，但他们却被公关人员经过反复训练，以免被作家烧伤。这种情况已经持续一段时间了。约翰·巴泰尔在撰写关于在线信息搜索的《搜索》(2005)时，花了一年多时间请求采访谷歌的联合创始人拉里·佩奇。该公司企图强加条件，比如有权提前阅读手稿并在提及谷歌的每个地方添加脚注及可能的反驳。他拒绝了。最终，谷歌还是同意了采访。

Why not the masters of Silicon Valley? Part of the problem is access, as is often the case when writing about the powerful. Tech executives may let their guards down at Burning Man, but they have been painstakingly trained by public-relations staff not to get burned by writers. This has been the case for a while. When John Battelle was writing “The Search” (2005), about online quests for information, he spent over a year asking to interview Google’s co-founder, Larry Page. The firm tried to impose conditions, such as the right to read the manuscript in advance and add a footnote and possible rebuttal to every mention of Google. He declined. Google ended up granting the interview anyway.

成功争取到访问权限的记者可能会感到自己对一家公司及其高管有所亏欠，进而写出俯首帖耳、心悦诚服的记述，而不是深入的散文。或者他们无法接近——甚至根本不尝试——然后从远处进行描写，缺乏内部见解。

Journalists who manage to finagle access can feel they owe a company and its executives and, in turn, write meek and sympathetic accounts rather than penetrating prose. Or they cannot break in—or do not even try—and write their book from a distance, without an insider’s insights.

两本新书展示了描写硅谷是多么困难。“过滤世界”是一位局外人对硅谷影响的描述，读起来就好像是完全在布鲁克林的一家咖啡店里报道和写成的。该书抱怨“文化陷入僵局，充斥着同质化”，并责怪硅谷的算法，“是困扰着我们这个21世纪初期时代的技术幽灵”。

Two new books demonstrate how hard it is to write well about Silicon Valley. “Filterworld” is an outsider’s account of the Valley’s impact, which reads as if it was entirely reported and written in a coffee shop in Brooklyn. The book laments how “culture is stuck and plagued by sameness” and blames Silicon Valley’s algorithms, “the technological spectre haunting our own era of the early 21st century”.

这种抨击科技的言论已经像硅谷的应用程序一样传播广泛。它并没有错，但也不具洞察力。作者凯尔·查伊卡是《纽约客》的记者，他从未消除他所痛斥的文化“同质化”与每个人所经历的个性化之间的紧张关系，因为在线用户拥有个性化信息流并生活在不同的信息泡泡中。这并非全新现象。人们自"记载文明"开始就一直在抱怨全球化侵蚀了当地文化，作者承认。1890年，法国社会学家加布里埃尔·塔德抱怨说，随着客运列车的传播，"旅馆食物和服务、家具、服饰和珠宝、剧院通告以及商店橱窗里的图书，都呈现出乏味的同质化"。

This is the sort of tirade against tech that has spread as widely as Silicon Valley’s apps. It is not wrong, but nor is it insightful. The author, Kyle Chayka, who is a journalist for the *New Yorker*, never reconciles the tension between the cultural “sameness” he decries and the personalisation everyone experiences, with online users possessing individual feeds and living in separate information bubbles. Nor is this a wholly new phenomenon. People have been complaining about globalisation eroding local culture since “recorded civilisation” began, the author concedes. In 1890 Gabriel Tarde, a French sociologist, lamented the “persistent sameness in hotel fare and service, in household furniture, in clothes and jewellery, in theatrical notices and in the volumes in shop windows” that spread with the passenger train.

“火烧书”是一本更好但仍有缺陷的阅读材料。卡拉·斯威舍，一位资深的硅谷史编写者，既是内部人士又是外部人士。她曾参加过科技亿万富翁们的宝宝派对，甚至在母亲的公寓里接待过谷歌的高层人员。但她对硅谷的“自恋狂，从未见过不想把功劳归于自己的创意”深感反感。

“Burn Book” is a better, though imperfect, read. Kara Swisher, a veteran chronicler of Silicon Valley, is both an insider and an outsider. She has attended baby showers for tech billionaires’ offspring and even hosted Google’s top brass for a sleepover at her mother’s apartment. But she has a distaste for the Valley’s “look-at-me narcissists, who never met an idea that they did not try to take credit for”.

她以细致生动的细节，对那些已经家喻户晓的技术大佬进行评判，比如Facebook的创始人：“当汗水从[马克·扎克伯格](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/02/06/musk-v-zuckerberg-whos-winning)苍白而圆润的脸上淌下来时，我想知道他是否会就此在我的脚下倒下。” 那是在2010年，在他经历过许多媒体训练之前。正如美国作家杜鲁门·卡波特愿意嘲讽纽约社交名媛一样，斯威舍女士乐于挑逗她的一些对象，使读者既感到愉悦又尴尬，比如媒体大亨鲁珀特·默多克(“撒旦叔叔”)和亚马逊的杰夫·贝索斯（他的“疯狂的笑声真的很具传染性”）。

In delicious detail, she offers her verdict on the techies who have become household names, such as Facebook’s founder: “As sweat poured down [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/02/06/musk-v-zuckerberg-whos-winning)’s pasty and rounded face, I wondered if he was going to keel over right there at my feet.” That was in 2010,before he had gone through media-training galore. Much as Truman Capote, an American writer, was willing to skewer the socialite swans of New York, Ms Swisher delights in prodding some of her subjects to make readers smile and squirm, such as media mogul Rupert Murdoch (“Uncle Satan”) and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos (who has “a genuinely infectious maniacal laugh”).

斯威舍女士没有卡波特的风采，但她的书之所以成功，在于其探讨了大多数科技书籍中隐藏着的主题和作家的关系。通过详细描述她与科技老板们三十年来的互动，她展示了这个行业如何变得更加隐秘和破坏性，少了自由和乐趣。

Ms Swisher does not have Capote’s élan, but her book succeeds where many fail because she explores the relationship between subject and writer, which lurks in the background of most tech books. In detailing her interactions with tech bosses over three decades, she shows how the industry became more furtive and destructive, less free and fun.

尽管斯威舍女士利用她的回忆录来奉献一面镜子，不幸的是，她并没有长时间地凝视它。在为《华盛顿邮报》、《华尔街日报》和她自己的机构Recode报道互联网之后，她从硅谷搬到了沼泽——华盛顿特区——承认“我已经太过依赖这个地方”，“成为了一个让人开始感到不舒服的场景的一部分”。

While Ms Swisher uses her memoir to hold up a mirror, unfortunately she does not gaze at it long. After chronicling the internet for the *Washington Post, Wall Street Journal* and her own outfit, Recode, she moved from the Valley to the swamp—Washington, DC—acknowledging that “I had become too much a creature of the place” and “part of the scene in a way that was starting to feel uncomfortable”.

尽管她拥有新闻化的凶猛，现实是，斯威舍女士无法将许多主人公批判，因为她依赖着他们接受她年度会议的邀请，这是她主要收入来源之一，以及依赖于她的播客。她不仅仅是“场景的一部分”——她扮演着领导角色。

Still, she declines to tease out some of the more complicated aspects of covering the Valley, such as the thin line between source, friend and adviser, and exactly how she covered the Valley dispassionately when her then-wife was a Google executive. Despite her journalistic ferocity, the reality was that Ms Swisher could not eviscerate many of her subjects, because she depended on them accepting her invitation to speak at her annual conference, one of her major sources of income, and on her podcast. She was not just “part of the scene”—she played a leading role.

当然，记者并不是唯一会处理个人冲突，影响他们如何以及写什么关于科技的人。硅谷中的许多人追求出书以巩固个人品牌，就像一个**具有脊梁（但读起来无骨气）的网站或简历**。这解释了为什么很多风险投资家开始涉足撰写书籍。其中最好的作品是[“从零到一”](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2014/09/20/from-one-who-should-know)（2014年）由Facebook的早期投资人彼得·蒂尔和斯坦福学生布莱克·马斯特斯共同撰写。然而，该书揭示了如何建立垄断地位，因为它以受欢迎和罕见的坦率展示，这可能是蒂尔先生及其同行后悔的事情，考虑到硅谷自那时起受到监管者的审查。当今不再流行垄断。

Of course, journalists are not the only ones who deal with personal conflicts that affect how and what they write about tech. Too many in the Valley pursue books to buttress their personal brand, like a website or résumé that just happens to have a spine (but reads as spineless). This explains why so many venture capitalists have ventured into book-writing. The best of the lot is [“Zero to One”](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2014/09/20/from-one-who-should-know) (2014) by Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook, and Blake Masters, a student who took a class taught by Mr Thiel at Stanford. However, explaining how to build a monopoly, as it does with welcome and rare frankness, is probably something Mr Thiel and his peers regret, considering the scrutiny Silicon Valley has since elicited from regulators. Monopolies are not so in vogue these days.

然而，讲述为什么写一本关于硅谷的书如此困难的最简单解释可能是最显而易见的：时间问题。研究和出版的缓慢步伐并不适合硅谷的速度。如今紧迫的图书理念在明年就变得陈旧。创新周期和公司的未来往往转变太快。

Yet the simplest explanation for why it is so hard for a book about Silicon Valley to hit the mark is probably the most obvious: timing. The snail’s pace of research and publishing is badly suited to Silicon Valley’s speed. Today’s pressing book idea is next year’s stale one. Innovation cycles and companies’ futures often pivot too quickly.

以记者亚当·拉辛斯基写了一本关于优步的书为例。他目睹该公司一落千丈，并试图保持他的文本最新。他恰如其名的《狂野之行》于2017年出版，就在[优步老板特拉维斯·卡兰尼克被戏剧性解雇的一个月前](https://www.economist.com/business/2017/06/22/travis-kalanick-steps-down-as-chief-executive-of-uber)。拉辛斯基先生此后发誓不再写科技方面的书。他的下一本书是关于已故报纸专栏作家威廉·萨菲尔的。这个主题永远不过时——也不会试图控制叙述。■

Take Adam Lashinsky, a journalist who wrote a book about Uber. He watched as the company faltered and tried to keep his text up to date. His aptly titled “Wild Ride” was published in 2017, a month before the [dramatic firing](https://www.economist.com/business/2017/06/22/travis-kalanick-steps-down-as-chief-executive-of-uber) of Uber’s boss, Travis Kalanick. Mr Lashinsky has since sworn off writing about tech. His next book is about William Safire, a dead newspaper columnist. It is a subject that will not go out of date—and not try to control the narrative. ■

气候变化一举掘起并抹去历史 (Climate change is unearthing and erasing history all at once)
=========================================================================

不断上升的海平面和极端天气正在危害考古学 (Rising sea levels and extreme weather are harming archaeology)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![斯旺德罗考古现场的考古学家们。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_CUP003.jpg)

乍一看，这看起来像一堆碎石。但在沙袋和防水帆布下面隐藏着斯旺德罗岗（Knowe of Swandro）的遗址，这里包含着铁器时代和挪威人的定居点的遗迹（如图所示）。每年夏天，一队考古学家会前往苏格兰北部的奥克尼群岛之一─**[奥克尼群岛](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/07/13/why-the-orkney-islands-are-considering-joining-norway)**─的劳塞岛，对证据进行仔细筛查。

IT LOOKS, at first glance, like a pile of rubble. But hidden beneath the sandbags and tarpaulin is the Knowe of Swandro, an archaeological site that contains the remains of Iron Age and Norse settlements (pictured). Every summer a team of archaeologists descends on Rousay, one of the [Orkney Islands](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/07/13/why-the-orkney-islands-are-considering-joining-norway), off the north coast of Scotland, to sift through the evidence.

时间不等人。上升的海平面和愈发频繁的暴风雨正在冲走遗址所在地的泥沙。据詹姆斯·哈顿研究所的一项研究显示，现在苏格兰的冬季降雨量比2050年的预测要多。**环境研究所**。沿海侵蚀已经摧毁了岗的明珠─一个铁器时代的住宅。「最后的三分之一」将分崩离析，并在「接下来的几年内」消失，共同领导挖掘工作的斯蒂芬·多克里尔（Stephen Dockrill）预测道。

Time is not on their side. Rising sea levels and more frequent storms are washing away sediment where the site sits. Scotland now experiences more winter rainfall than had been predicted for 2050, according to a study by the James Hutton Institute, which conducts environmental research. Coastal erosion has destroyed most of the Knowe’s crown jewel, a dwelling from the Iron Age. “The final third” will break apart and disappear “within the next couple of years”, predicts Stephen Dockrill, who co-leads the excavation.

联合国的文化机构教科文组织估计，每六个文化遗产地中就有一个受到气候变化的威胁。苏格兰沿岸数以百计的遗址面临着斯旺德罗类似的威胁。在英格兰北部的温多兰达（Vindolanda），保存罗马文字片的泥土已经变得干燥，无法再提供保护。在伊拉克，一个古城正被数吨沙子埋葬。而在北极，**永久冻土**的融化导致土著文物遭受破坏。

Unesco, the cultural arm of the United Nations, estimates that one in six cultural heritage sites is threatened by climate change. Hundreds of sites on the Scottish coastline face threats similar to Swandro. At Vindolanda, in the north of England, the waterlogged soil that preserved Roman tablets for millennia is drying out. In Iraq, an ancient city is being buried under tonnes of sand. And in the Arctic, indigenous artefacts are being destroyed as the [permafrost thaws](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/a-lot-of-arctic-infrastructure-is-threatened-by-rising-temperatures/21807133).

在应对气候变化的工作清单上，考古保护理所当然不是首要任务。国际古迹与遗址理事会直到2020年才宣布气候紧急状态。考古学家抱怨气候决策者间的协调工作表面化。

On the climate change to-do list, archaeological preservation is, understandably, not a top priority. The International Council on Monuments and Sites declared a climate emergency only in 2020. Archaeologists complain of shallow co-ordination efforts among climate policymakers.

**资金**是主要问题。考古学往往由地产开发商提供资金支持。但在应对气候变化时，像丹麦国家博物馆的约根·霍莱森（Jorgen Hollesen）所说，“没有人愿意为此买单”。迁移遗址和其他缓解措施，比如建造防护设施，都需要大笔花费。许多人只能等待看看会发生什么。

Funding is the main problem. Archaeology tends to be bankrolled by land developers. But when it comes to climate change, there is “no one to pay for it”, says Jorgen Hollesen from the National Museum of Denmark. Moving sites and other mitigation efforts, such as building protective armour, is costly. Many just have to wait and see what happens.

进一步挖掘，情况并非全是末日和悲观。气候模式的转变和温度上升带来了一些意想不到的好处。近年来一些最激动人心的发现，从多瑙河中的纳粹战船到亚马逊中的古代岩石雕刻，都是在严重干旱后被揭露出来。风暴也能暴露出隐藏的珍宝。奥克尼的尼奥利迪克斯岛（Skara Brae）被沙丘掩埋，直到1850年的一场风暴扰乱了它。类似情况下，一个数百年前的沉船在今年也再度露出水面。

Digging deeper, it is not all doom and gloom. Changing weather patterns and rising temperatures have brought some unexpected benefits. Several of the most exciting discoveries of recent years, from Nazi warships in the Danube to ancient rock carvings in the Amazon, were revealed after severe drought. Storms can also expose hidden gems. [Skara Brae](https://www.economist.com/1843/2017/02/27/this-island-life), a Neolithic site also in Orkney, was concealed by sand dunes until disturbed by a storm in 1850. A centuries-old shipwreck reappeared under similar circumstances this year.

根据丹麦国家博物馆的霍莱森博士所说，考古学家和文物机构必须回答两个紧迫问题：“哪些遗址应予以拯救，哪些遗址应允许衰落？”在经济条件较差的国家，为保护而支付费用可能难以证明合理，尽管教科文组织为其指定的世界遗产地提供资金支持（撒哈拉以南非洲有103个，意大利有59个）。教科文组织世界遗产中心主任拉扎尔·埃龙杜·阿索莫（Lazare Eloundou Assomo）表示，资源较少的国家将获得资金优先支持。

Archaeologists and heritage institutions must answer two pressing questions, says Dr Hollesen: “Which sites should be saved, and which sites should be allowed to decay?” In poor countries, paying for preservation can be hard to justify, though unesco provides funding to its designated World Heritage sites. (Sub-Saharan Africa has 103; Italy has 59.) Countries with fewer resources will get priority in funding, says Lazare Eloundou Assomo, the head of UNESCO’s World Heritage Centre.

考虑到处于威胁下的遗址数量和有限的可用资源，许多遗址将会丢失。随着遗址的受损或消失，历史知识和旅游资源也将相应消逝。苏格兰历史环境管理局的梅丽·戴维斯（Mairi Davies）表示，社区必须接受不断变化的景观并做出相应调整。斯旺德罗等遗址开始使用激光扫描和**其他技术**，制作数字记录供未来世代参考。“我们必须就损失进行讨论，以及人们看重什么，”戴维斯博士说。最终，什么能保存下来将取决于人们“可以接受失去什么”。没有足够的资金可以拯救它们全部。■

Given the number of sites under threat and limited resources available, many will be lost. As sites are damaged or disappear, historical knowledge and tourism may also go away. According to Mairi Davies of Historic Environment Scotland, which works on preservation, communities must come to terms with changing landscapes—and adapt accordingly. Sites such as Swandro are turning to laser scanning and [other technologies](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/06/13/the-race-to-digitally-preserve-ukraines-buildings-and-monuments) to capture a digital record for future generations. “We have to have conversations about loss and what people value,” Dr Davies says. In the end, what survives will be determined by what people “can come to terms with losing”. There is not enough money to save them all. ■

马斯特里赫特是博物馆疯狂购物的地方 (Maastricht is where museums go on shopping sprees)
==================================================================

一个举办在荷兰小城市的展会是艺术世界和收藏趋势的一扇窗。 (A fair in a small Dutch city is a window on the art world and collecting trends)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![一名女性正在查看在TEFAF马斯特里赫特展出的一幅画。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_CUP001.jpg)

**绘画**被聚光灯照亮，这样你可以看到每一笔和裂缝。每件作品旁边都有一块牌子，概述其历史和曾经归属于谁。这里有一幅精美装裱的绘画，可能是18世纪那不勒斯国王赠予教宗本笃十四世的礼物(如图)。附近是一幅470年历史的描绘一位披貂皮的女预言家的肖像，曾经是美国演员[保罗·纽曼](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2008/10/02/paul-newman)和琼安·伍德沃德拥有的。马斯特里赫特展出的艺术品让人联想到博物馆展览，除了一个例外，这里的一切都是待售的。

THE PAINTINGS are spotlighted, so you can see every brushstroke and crack. Next to each work is a placard, outlining its history and to whom it once belonged. Here is an elaborately framed painting, probably offered by the King of Naples to Pope Benedict XIV in the 18th century (pictured). Nearby is a 470-year-old portrait of a sibyl wearing ermine, once owned by [Paul Newman](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2008/10/02/paul-newman) and Joanne Woodward, two American actors. The artwork on display in Maastricht is reminiscent of a museum exhibition, except for one catch. Here, everything is for sale.

自1988年开始，每年三月，欧洲古董艺术基金会(TEFAF)在这个荷兰小城举办一场展会，这里最为人所知的是作为现代欧盟的诞生地(1992年签署了创立该组织的条约)。现在这里成为了博物馆和艺术爱好者购物的地方。“马斯特里赫特”，如艺术圈内部人士所称呼的，“在古典绘画和艺术品方面是无可争议的最重要的博览会”，伦敦的一个画廊主 Jonathan Green说。这场为期八天的博览会于3月7日开幕。

Every March since 1988 the European Fine Art Foundation (TEFAF) has put on a fair in the small Dutch city, best known as the birthplace of the modern-day European Union (the treaty that created it was signed here in 1992). Now this is where museums and art aficionados come to shop. “Maastricht”, as art-world insiders call it, is “the most important fair by a mile for classical paintings and works of art”, says Jonathan Green, a gallerist based in London. The eight-day fair opened on March 7th.

马斯特里赫特不是唯一一个贵价艺术品被出售的展会，但它可能拥有最多博物馆馆长，他们正在寻找下一件收藏品。今年的5万名参观者中包括约300名博物馆馆长，包括管理巴黎卢浮宫的劳伦斯·德·卡尔(Laurence des Cars)和650名策展人。这里是古代艺术的首选之地，不同于瑞士巴塞尔和迈阿密等展会更倾向于当代绘画。马斯特里赫特是“艺术界的大都会”，而巴塞尔艺术展则是“现代艺术博览会”，德克萨斯州沃思堡基姆贝尔博物馆的馆长埃里克·李(Eric Lee)说。

Maastricht is not the only fair where expensive art is sold, but it probably boasts the largest concentration of museum curators on the hunt for their next acquisition. Among this year’s 50,000 visitors were some 300 museum directors—including Laurence des Cars, who runs the Louvre in Paris—and 650 curators. It is the premier destination for old art, as opposed to the contemporary paintings that fairs like Art Basel in Switzerland and Miami favour. Maastricht is the “Met of art fairs, and Art Basel is MoMA”, says Eric Lee, director of the Kimbell Museum in Fort Worth, Texas.

博览会启动前发生的事情也很不寻常。商家们布置好他们的展位，但却不得不离开。在一天半的时间里，230名专家前来审查作品的真实性，以及它们的描述和来源，他们携带着X光和其他技术设备。

What happens before the fair begins is also unusual. Dealers set up their stands, only to be forced to leave. For a day and a half 230 specialists come in to vet works’ [authenticity](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/01/07/new-tools-are-making-it-easier-to-authenticate-paintings), as well as their descriptions and stated provenance, bringing x-rays and other technical machines with them.

专家们有权要求更改描述。如果专家们认为有不真实的作品，那么这些物品将会被移除并锁在柜子里，直到博览会结束后才释放。“你再次进来，希望上帝保佑没有任何东西被扔掉，”一位商贩说，他称马斯特里赫特为“全球最严格的展会”。

The specialists have the right to ask for descriptions to be changed. Objects can be removed if the experts believe they are inauthentic; they are locked in a cupboard until after the fair. “You come back in and hope to God that nothing has been thrown out,” says one dealer, who calls Maastricht “the best-vetted fair in the world”.

每年根据TEFAF的Will Korner介绍，“数十”件物品会被移除。但是严格的审查流程使得商家们特别努力确保他们展品能经得起审查。这给了购买者信心，包括博物馆，在博物馆采购委员会希望确认他们是在购买真正的作品。

Each year “tens” of objects are removed, according to Will Korner of TEFAF. But the strict vetting process means dealers work especially hard to ensure their offerings can withstand scrutiny. This gives confidence to buyers, including museums, whose acquisition committees want to be confident they are buying the real deal.

除了是一个欣赏令人叹为观止的艺术品的地方，马斯特里赫特还提供了一个展示艺术界和当前收藏趋势的窗口。这场博览会以古典绘画而闻名，但与会的当代画廊数量正在增加——因为那是艺术市场的主要活动区域。根据研究机构艺术经济学的最新报告，在全球拍卖销售价值中，去年欧洲古代大师(即1250年至1820年出生的艺术家创作的作品)占不到4%。而2003年的比例是16%。

As well as being a destination to ogle breathtaking art, Maastricht offers a window on the art world and current collecting trends. The fair is best known for Old Master paintings, but the number of contemporary dealers in attendance has been growing—because that is where most of the activity in the art market is. Last year European Old Masters (defined as work produced by artists born between 1250 and 1820) accounted for less than 4% of the value of sales at auction globally, according to a new report by Arts Economics, a research firm. In 2003 it was 16%.

具有历史重要性的艺术家创作的杰作仍然卖得很好。例如，2021年，意大利艺术家桑德罗·波提切利的一幅画以9200万美元售出。但市场中间部分已经消失，这归因于审美和室内设计的变化。许多当今的艺术收藏家更青睐于大尺寸、色彩鲜艳的画布，这样可以与其极简家具和大片白墙相得益彰。一位商人将现时不流行的荷兰古典景观画描述为“巴克大道（Park Avenue）”风格。社交媒体改变了销售策略。现代画不容易拍出好效果，由于这类画作的年代久远，买家需要亲自检查其状况。因此，古代大师画的商家们正在努力提高营销技巧。“我们试图销售更多血腥、性感和神话主题的作品，”纽约画廊Adam Williams Fine Art的Patrick Williams说。然而，基督信仰的血腥钉在十字架上的形象不再时髦：在年轻收藏家和中东亚洲地区的人士中，世俗作品更受欢迎。马斯特里赫特的人们谈论“墙体力量”：那些能吸引视线并引发讨论的形象。

Masterpieces by historically significant artists still do well. In 2021 a painting by Sandro Botticelli, the Italian artist of Venus-on-the-half-shell fame, sold for $92m, for example. But the middle has fallen out of the market, owing to changes in aesthetics and interior design. Many of today’s art collectors favour large, colourful canvases by living or recently living artists, to complement their minimalist furniture and large, white walls. (“Park Avenue” taste is how one dealer describes an old Dutch landscape he has for sale, which is now out of favour.)

作品的作者也很重要。“当前市场上最大的趋势是女性，”拍卖行[苏富比](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/01/31/the-sothebys-trial-revealed-the-art-markets-unsavoury-practices)古代大师绘画部门的联合主席亚历山大·贝尔(Alexander Bell)说。一个展位在马斯特里赫特展示了三幅来自[female artists](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/05/16/why-womens-art-sells-at-a-discount)的画作，并配有大幅标语：“女壁”。博物馆积极购买，因为他们希望扩大他们展出的艺术家的作品和背景。但选择范围并不多。Williams先生说：“对女性艺术家的需求相当激烈：我们一旦拿到她们的作品，立刻就会出售。”

Social media have changed what sells, says Christophe van de Weghe, a contemporary-art dealer. Old Masters do not photograph as well, and, given the paintings’ age, buyers need to check their condition in person. So dealers of Old Masters are trying to become more masterful at marketing. “We’re trying to sell more blood, sex and mythology,”says Patrick Williams of Adam Williams Fine Art, a gallerist based in New York. (However, images of bloody Christ on the cross are not in vogue: secular works are more popular among younger collectors and those from the Middle East and Asia.) People at Maastricht talk about “wall power”: images that can catch the eye and spark conversations.

事实上，无论是过去世纪男性艺术家的作品还是女性艺术家的作品，供应量越来越少。不同于当代艺术，后者每天都有更多的创作，而来自已故艺术家的供应受限，这是显而易见的原因。更多的作品正消失于博物馆收藏之中或被捐赠给机构。“由于高品质作品的供应变得更加稀缺，交易变得更具挑战性，”Green先生说。对于乐观主义者来说，这意味着作为一类被低估的古代大师画作。至少，这是马斯特里赫特的买家们想的。■

Who painted the canvas matters, too. The “biggest trend in the current market is women,” says Alexander Bell, co-chairman of the Old Masters painting department at [Sotheby’s](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/01/31/the-sothebys-trial-revealed-the-art-markets-unsavoury-practices), an auction house. Should anyone doubt it, one stand at Maastricht displayed three paintings by [female artists](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/05/16/why-womens-art-sells-at-a-discount) adorned with a large sign: “Wall of Ladies”. Museums are avid buyers, as they seek to expand the works and backgrounds of the artists they exhibit. But there are not many to choose from. “It’s a bit of a frenzy” for female artists, says Mr Williams: “Any time we get them, we sell them immediately.”

The reality is that there is less and less for sale by both women and men from bygone centuries. Unlike contemporary art, more of which is created every day, the supply from dead artists is—for obvious reasons—limited. More is disappearing into museum collections or being given by donors to institutions. “The trade is becoming more challenging, because of a scarcity of high-quality paintings available to sell,” says Mr Green. To optimists this suggests that Old Masters as a category are undervalued. At least, that’s what buyers at Maastricht like to think. ■

1843年的双重谋杀拉开了一段新时代小报新闻的序幕 (A double murder in 1843 ushered in a new era of tabloid journalism)
===========================================================================================

Polly Bodine的审判成为萌芽中的耸人听闻的新闻报道的完美素材。 (The trial of Polly Bodine proved perfect material for a nascent, sensationalist press)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![一幅画，描述了波莉·博丁离开现场，艾米琳·豪斯曼和她的孩子被大火吞噬。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_CUP505.jpg)

**纽约女巫**。亚历克斯·霍蒂斯著。*天马犯罪; 336页; 售价29.95美元和22英镑*

**The Witch of New York.** By Alex Hortis. *Pegasus Crime; 336 pages; $29.95 and £22*

那是1843年的圣诞节，一群男人聚集在斯塔滕岛上的一家小酒馆里共度节日。当他们听到喧闹声时，放下手中的啤酒杯。在扑灭乔治·豪斯曼家中的大火后，他们检查了残骸。在厨房的一个角落里，他们发现了他妻子和年幼女儿焦黑的尸体。尸检结果显示有钝器伤痕。

It was Christmas Day in 1843, and men were gathered in a tavern on Staten Island for a festive drink. They set down their pints when they heard shouting. After extinguishing the flames engulfing George Houseman’s home, they inspected the wreckage. In a corner of the kitchen, they found the charred remains of his wife and young daughter. A post-mortem revealed evidence of blunt trauma.

豪斯曼是一名沙滩养殖工，当时正在海上。人们很快开始将矛头指向他的妹妹波莉·博丁（如图片所示）。她曾在12月23日睡在家里，这是她经常在哥哥不在时过夜的地方，被认为是最后一个见到受害者的人。当博丁听说村民们开始将谋杀责任推到她身上时，她逃走了，但几天后她向当局自首。

Houseman, an oysterman, was at sea. People soon started to direct blame at his sister, Polly Bodine (pictured). She had slept at the house on December 23rd, as she often did when her brother was away, and was thought to be the last person to see the victims alive. When word reached Bodine that villagers were starting to pin responsibility for the murders on her, she fled, but a couple of days later she turned herself in to the authorities.

《纽约女巫》详细重建了事件和随后的审判。犯罪历史学家亚历克斯·霍蒂斯之所以能够这样做，是因为媒体关注了这起案件，并乐于叙述其可怕的细节。新兴的“便士报刊”记者，即专门报道耸人听闻和庸俗内容的廉价报纸，往返于纽约，带来了现场的报道。

“The Witch of New York” reconstructs the events and subsequent trials in great detail. Alex Hortis, a crime historian, can do so because the press seized on the case and delighted in recounting its grisly details. Journalists for the emerging “penny press”—cheap newspapers that specialised in the lurid and schlocky—shuttled to and from [New York](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/12/14/a-gripping-history-of-new-york) with dispatches from the crime scene.

结果表明，博丁是一个完美的话题，因为她不仅被怀疑是谋杀犯和纵火犯，而且她的个人生活也很丰富多彩。她逃离了一段虐待的婚姻，回到父母家居住；她的丈夫因重婚罪而入狱。然而，博丁并不是一个孤独的老姑娘。她在城里找了个情人，谋杀发生时她怀着八个月身孕。她成为她的同时代人对性的感受的焦点。

Bodine turned out to be the perfect subject, for not only was she a suspected murderess and arsonist—she had a colourful personal life, too. She had fled an abusive marriage and returned to live with her parents; her husband was in prison for bigamy. Yet Bodine was no lonely spinster. She had taken a lover in the city and was eight months pregnant when the murders were committed. She became a lightning rod for her contemporaries’ feelings about sex.

印刷机长时间繁忙地运作，发布耸人听闻的故事和贬低的插图。如果无法获得事实，狂野的想象也足够了。(谣言涵盖了从她所谓的堕胎到她可能犯下的其他谋杀案的一切。)博丁引发对她如此炽热的媒体报道，以至于使得正当法律程序变得不可能。在斯塔滕岛上初审无果后，该地区的重审不得不放弃，因为三天的陪审团选拔并未提供12个公正的陪审团员。

The printing presses ran hot for years, publishing sensationalist stories and denigrating illustrations. If facts could not be had, wild invention sufficed. (The rumours covered everything from her supposed abortions to other murders she might have committed.) So fervid was the press coverage of Bodine that it made due process impossible. After an initial mistrial in Staten Island, a retrial there had to be abandoned, as three days of jury selection failed to proffer 12 unbiased men.

在曼哈顿进行了一次新审判，但在裁决有罪后，最高法院裁定博丁被剥夺了公平听证的权利。之后，潜在的陪审团员被广泛询问他们对案件的印象，陪审团的选拔变得几乎不可能。经过三个星期和数千名潜在陪审团员后，第三次也是最后一次的审判被转移到了60英里（97公里）之外的纽伯格。在那里，博丁被判无罪。

A new trial took place in Manhattan, but after a guilty verdict was delivered, the Supreme Court ruled that Bodine had been denied a fair hearing. Afterwards potential jurors were quizzed extensively about their impressions of the case, and selection came close to impossible. After three weeks and several thousand prospective jurors, the third and final trial was moved to Newburgh, some 60 miles (97km) away. There Bodine was found not guilty.

这是一个引人入胜的故事，叙述得很熟练。这个案件吸引了众多名人。埃德加·爱伦·坡和沃尔特·惠特曼都写过关于审讯的文章；詹姆斯·芬尼莫尔·库珀在一部小说中对这个可怕的故事进行了虚构。P.T. 巴纳姆在他的美国博物馆展出了一尊可怕的女巫形象的蜡像。 （他与音乐剧电影中展示的“最伟大的万花筒”形象有些不同）

It is an engaging story, skilfully told. The case pulled stars into its orbit. Both [Edgar Allan Poe](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2008/01/31/the-blasted-soul) and Walt Whitman wrote about the trials; James Fenimore Cooper fictionalised the grim tale in a novel. P.T. Barnum exhibited a hideous witchy waxwork of Bodine in his American Museum. (He comes across as a rather less genial fellow than “The Greatest Showman”, a musical film, would have you believe.)

霍蒂斯先生称博丁“可能”犯下了这些罪行；读者在完成这本书时会对此存有合理的怀疑。 无论是否有罪，博丁的案件树立了一个危险的先例，开启了一个“小报司法”时代，这个时代“破坏了法律正义并掩盖了真相”。它还奠定了对女性被告进行公开羞辱和淫秽猜测的模式。多年来，对肮脏、暴力犯罪的兴趣仍未减退：阅读《纽约女巫》可以理解当前真实犯罪狂潮的渊源。报道博丁案的记者表明，娱乐比正义更重要。■

Mr Hortis says Bodine “probably” did commit the crimes; the reader will finish the book with reasonable doubts. Guilty or not, Bodine’s case set a dangerous precedent, ushering in an age of “tabloid justice” that “undermines legal justice and obscures truth”. It also established a pattern of public shaming and lewd speculation about female defendants. Interest in sordid, violent crimes has not abated in the years since: to read “The Witch of New York” is to understand the ancestry of the current [true-crime craze.](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/08/08/an-infamous-murderer-and-the-truth-about-true-crime) The reporters covering Bodine’s case showed that justice was less important than entertainment. ■

=============================================================

Percival Everett的《詹姆斯》以独特的方式重新演绎了马克·吐温的经典故事 (Percival Everett’s “James” imagines Mark Twain’s classic tale with a twist)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![来自《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》1960年的截图。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_CUP504.jpg)

**詹姆斯。** 作者：珀西瓦尔·埃弗里特。*Doubleday；* *320页；售价28美元。将于四月由Mantle出版公司在英国发行；售价20英镑*

**James.** By Percival Everett. *Doubleday;* *320 pages; $28. To be published in Britain by Mantle in April; £20*

在密苏里州汉尼拔的一个月明之夜，一名名叫吉姆的奴隶看着两个躲在草丛中的白人男孩。“那些家伙”以为他看不见他们。“他们总是玩着某种假装游戏，我要么是恶棍，要么是猎物，但肯定是他们的玩具，”吉姆想。哈克和他的朋友汤姆·索亚突然笑个不停：“那些男孩在乐队演奏时连盲聋人都潜不到身边。”吉姆决定纵容他们——因为“满足白人的需求总是划算的。”他走进院子，呼喊着黑夜中：“谁在黑暗中如此？”

On a moonlit night in Hannibal, Missouri, a slave called Jim watches two white boys hiding in the grass. The “little bastards” think he cannot see them. “They were always playing some kind of pretending game where I was either a villain or prey, but certainly their toy,” Jim thinks. Huck and his friend, Tom Sawyer, rustle and giggle: “Those boys couldn’t sneak up on a blind and deaf man while a band was playing.” Jim decides to indulge them anyway—because “it always pays to give white folks what they want.” Stepping into the yard, he calls out into the night, “Who dat dere in da dark lak dat?”

于是，珀西瓦尔·埃弗里特的小说《詹姆斯》由此开始，重新想象了[马克·吐温](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2010/04/15/more-than-just-a-phunny-phellow)的《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》，而视角却是吉姆。埃弗里特先生是南加州大学的英语文学教授，以不拘一格的作品而闻名，从讽刺出版业的作品激发了电影《American Fiction》，到讲述美国南部私刑的侦探小说（《The Trees》曾入围2022年布克奖）。

So begins “James”, a novel by Percival Everett that reimagines [Mark Twain](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2010/04/15/more-than-just-a-phunny-phellow)’s “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” from Jim’s perspective. Mr Everett, a professor of English literature at the University of Southern California, is known for producing genre-defying works, ranging from a satire of the publishing industry that inspired the film “American Fiction” to a murder mystery about lynchings in the American South. (“The Trees” was shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2022.)

通过对扭转Twain经典美国故事的重新讲述，埃弗里特先生加入了将边缘化角色拉到全新（但又旧）故事中心的作家长居传统。这种现代趋势始于[《Wide Sargasso Sea》](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2016/10/27/fifty-years-of-wide-sargasso-sea)（1966年），琼·赖斯让罗切斯特的妻子——《简爱》中那位“疯人阁楼”——有了自己的声音，作者为夏洛特·勃朗特的[《简爱》](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/08/10/how-charlotte-bronte-came-to-write-jane-eyre)。

In retelling Twain’s classic American tale with a twist, Mr Everett joins a long tradition of writers who have dragged marginalised characters into the centre of new (old) tales. The modern trend began with [“Wide Sargasso Sea”](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2016/10/27/fifty-years-of-wide-sargasso-sea) (1966), when Jean Rhys gave a voice to Mr Rochester’s wife, the “madwoman in the attic”, from [“Jane Eyre”](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/08/10/how-charlotte-bronte-came-to-write-jane-eyre) by Charlotte Brontë.

最近流行的重讲故事有两种类型。一种是对以男性为中心的作品进行女性主义修正。马德琳·米勒的[《西西里岛女巫》](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/04/26/in-times-of-crisis-writers-turn-to-homer)（2018年）以小女神西西里的视角重新讲述了《奥德赛》，帕特·巴克的[《女子的沉默》](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/09/13/pat-barker-beautifully-fills-in-the-gaps-in-the-iliad)（同样是2018年）则设想了达到女人被阿喀琉斯占有的特洛伊女王视角的《伊利亚特》。去年桑德拉·纽曼的《朱莉娅》重新讲述了乔治·奥威尔的《1984》，为先前瘦弱角色提供了肉体和心灵。

Two types of retellings have been popular recently. One involves feminist revisions of books focused on men. [“Circe”](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/04/26/in-times-of-crisis-writers-turn-to-homer) (2018) by Madeline Miller retold the “Odyssey” from the perspective of Circe, a minor goddess; Pat Barker’s [“The Silence of the Girls”](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/09/13/pat-barker-beautifully-fills-in-the-gaps-in-the-iliad) (also 2018) imagined the “Iliad” from the viewpoint of a Trojan queen taken as a slave by Achilles. Last year [“Julia”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/08/04/interest-in-george-orwell-and-his-dystopian-fiction-is-high) by Sandra Newman retold George Orwell’s “1984”, offering meat and mind to a previously scrawny character.

《詹姆斯》是另一种重讲旧故事的例子，它突显了以前以白人为中心的故事中的非白人角色。这并非全新之举：艾丽斯·兰德尔在《风靡的已走》（2001年）里重新书写了玛格丽特·米切尔的《飘》故事，从一个奴隶的视角出发。随着读者要求新鲜视角，越来越多的作者尝试进行改编。成功者不仅仅是对熟悉故事进行微调，而是打造出崭新的作品，看起来原创而挑衅。

“James” is an example of another sort of retelling, which gives prominence to non-white characters from tales previously focused on white ones. This is not entirely new: in “The Wind Done Gone” (2001), Alice Randall rewrote Margaret Mitchell’s “Gone With the Wind” from a slave’s perspective. As readers demand fresh perspectives, more authors are trying their hand at adaptations. Successful ones do not just tweak familiar stories but create something entirely new, therefore reading as original and defiant.

从Huck的视角切换到Jim的视角就是这样一种行为。考虑开场场景。在Twain的原著小说中，最初出版于1885年的美国（后来因为糟糕的语言而在马萨诸塞州被禁止），男孩们悄悄接近Jim要对他“玩弄一番”。他们视他为愚蠢和迷信的。 （小说中出现了约200次"N"字，这使得这本书成为学校里频繁引起争议的焦点。）

The shift from Huck’s perspective to Jim’s is such an act. Consider the opening scene. In Twain’s original novel, first published in America in 1885 (and banned in Massachusetts shortly afterwards because of its bad language), the boys sneak up on Jim to “play something on him”. They see him as dumb and superstitious. (The N-word appears around 200 times in the novel, which has made the book a frequent flashpoint in schools.)

埃弗里特先生的重述之妙地想象了吉姆的内心世界，同时保持了Twain场景的完整性。吉姆看见草丛中的男孩们却装作没有看见。他的叙述聪慧风趣，但当他大声说话时却装傻。埃弗里特先生用几行字将Twain的故事颠倒了过来。

The brilliance of Mr Everett’s retelling is to imagine Jim’s interiority while maintaining the integrity of Twain’s scene. Jim sees the boys in the grass but pretends not to. His narration is intelligent and witty, but when he speaks aloud, he plays dumb. With a few lines, Mr Everett has turned Twain’s tale on its head.

《詹姆斯》就是这样展开的，让熟悉的场景感觉令人惊讶而新颖。然而，您无需阅读原著就能享受这个翻版；埃弗里特的故事自成一体。和Twain的小说一样，吉姆逃跑以避免被卖给新主人并与家人分离，而Huck则伪装死亡以躲避虐待他的父亲。这对不太可能的搭档乘着筏子顺流而下密西西比河，在旅程中遭遇各种危险和障碍。

“James” unfolds in this fashion, making familiar scenes feel startling and new. You do not need to read the original to enjoy the revision, however; Mr Everett’s tale stands on its own.As in Twain’s novel, Jim runs away to avoid being sold to a new slave-owner and separated from his family. Huck fakes his death to get away from his abusive father. The unlikely pair escape by raft down the Mississippi river, encountering all kinds of dangers and obstacles on their journey.

吉姆已秘密教会自己阅读和写作，找到纸张和墨水。“我被叫做吉姆，”他写道。“我还没选择一个名字。”他与Huck讨论道德问题，Huck想知道帮助吉姆逃跑是否“犯错”。“如果你需要某种上帝来告诉你是非对错的话，那么你永远也无法知道，”吉姆明智地建议。

Jim, who has secretly taught himself to read and write, finds paper and ink. “I am called Jim,” he writes. “I have yet to choose a name.” He discusses morality with Huck, who wonders if he’s “doin’ wrong” by helping Jim escape. “If’n ya need sum kinda God to tells ya right from wrong, den you won’t never know,” Jim advises wisely.

在埃弗里特的叙述中，吉姆的奴隶方言是一种假装。他在其他奴隶面前不使用，但在有白人出现时会说“法律，法律”。他解释道：“白人希望我们以某种方式说话，如果我们不让他们失望，只会让我们受益。”他建议奴隶儿童咕哝，表现愚蠢，并使用“正确的错误语法”。让白人感到安全和优越是为了生存。

In Mr Everett’s telling, Jim’s slave dialect is a put-on. He drops it around other slaves, but reverts to “lawdy, lawdy” when a white person appears. “White folks expect us to sound a certain way and it can only help if we don’t disappoint them,” he explains. He advises slave children to mumble, sound stupid and use “correct incorrect grammar”. Making whites feel safe and superior is a matter of survival.

当吉姆和Huck分开时，埃弗里特为吉姆设计了比Twain文本中更加黑暗和血腥的新考验。然而，中心线索仍然是逃亡奴隶和男孩之间的关系。Huck在荒野中保护吉姆，但吉姆也觉得对Huck负责，后者对奴隶制度越来越感到不安。最后，埃弗里特引入一个转折，以及充满戏剧性复仇场景，读起来就像注定要在大银幕上再现一样。“我的名字叫詹姆斯，”吉姆在某一刻宣布。“我要找回我的家人。”（你几乎可以听到这些台词将伴随的戏剧性配乐，也许会想知道哪位演员将扮演吉姆。）

When Jim and Huck are separated, Mr Everett invents new trials for Jim that are darker and bloodier than anything in Twain’s text. The central thread, however, remains the relationship between the runaway slave and the boy. Huck protects Jim in the wilderness, but Jim also feels responsible for Huck, who grows increasingly uncomfortable with slavery. Toward the end, Mr Everett introduces a twist, as well as action-packed scenes of revenge that read like they are destined for re-enactment on the big screen. “My name is James,” Jim declares at one point. “I’m going to get my family.” (You can almost hear the dramatic score that will accompany these lines and might wonder which actor will play Jim.)

无论《詹姆斯》是否取得商业成功，重述的趋势只会继续。作家们总是寻找经典故事来评论当代时代。莎士比亚的《哈姆雷特》改编自丹麦传说阿姆勒斯。弥尔顿的《失乐园》重述了圣经的[创世记](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2012/12/01/the-starting-point)。读者喜欢一则熟悉的故事搭配新奇的转折和引人深思的见解。对出版商来说，这使得改编作品成为一个不错的选择，容易推广且一定畅销。■

Whether or not “James” is a commercial success, the trend of retellings is only likely to continue. Writers have always looked to classic tales to comment on contemporary times. Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” adapted the Danish legend of Amleth. Milton’s “Paradise Lost” rewrote the Bible’s [Book of Genesis](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2012/12/01/the-starting-point). Readers love the comfort of a familiar story remixed with surprising twists and provocative insights. For publishers, that makes retellings a good bet—easy to market and sure to sell. ■

伊索寓言如何在俄罗斯孵化了一门秘密的抗议语言 (How Aesop’s fables fostered a secret language of protest in Russia)
========================================================================================

对阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼的编码致敬揭示了伊索寓言的悠久余生 (Coded tributes to Alexei Navalny reveal the long afterlife of Aesop’s fables)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![一名参与者在莫斯科一场未经授权的抗议政府集会上拿着一只黄色塑料鸭子](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240316_CUP002.jpg)

在2024年2月下旬，橡胶鸭子开始出现在不太可能的地方。有人发现一只橡胶鸭子在圣彼得堡的玫瑰丛中窥视；另一只被塑料手电筒照亮，靠近伏尔加河的一条支流。在俄罗斯最知名的反对派领袖阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼仍然活着时，橡胶鸭子象征着他对抗腐败的斗争。自[他于2月16日去世](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2024/02/22/alexei-navalny-didnt-just-defy-putin-he-showed-up-his-depravity)，它们扮演了不同的角色：抗议暗杀他的政权，同时避开审查。

In late February 2024, rubber ducks started landing in unlikely places. One was spotted peering through roses in St Petersburg; another was illuminated by plastic torches next to a tributary of the Volga river. When Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, was alive, rubber ducks symbolised his fight against corruption. Since [his death on February 16th](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2024/02/22/alexei-navalny-didnt-just-defy-putin-he-showed-up-his-depravity), they have played a different role: to protest against the regime that murdered him, while evading censorship.

古希腊的奴隶伊索被认为最先运用会说话的动物来讲述关于道德的寓言。在俄罗斯，动物形象携带着编码的意义。有一大堆例子，比如一只鹅嘎嘎叫的贴纸。（鹅的叫声被写作“嘎-嘎-嘎”，类似于“Ha-aga”，俄语中海牙（The Hague）的发音，那里是[弗拉基米尔·普京](https://www.economist.com/culture/writers-have-grappled-with-vladimir-putin-for-two-decades/21808311)，俄罗斯总统，应该因在乌克兰的战争罪受审的地方。）划掉的鱼的涂鸦是对乌克兰的另一个暗示：俄语中的“没有战争”和“没有咸鱼”有着相近数量的字母。

Aesop, a slave in Ancient Greece, is credited with invoking talking animals to tell tales about morality. In Russia, images of animals carry coded meaning. There is a herd of examples, such as stickers of a goose cawing. (The sound made by a goose is written as “ga-ga-ga”, similar to “Ha-aga”, the Russian pronunciation of The Hague, where [Vladimir Putin](https://www.economist.com/culture/writers-have-grappled-with-vladimir-putin-for-two-decades/21808311), Russia’s president, should be tried for war crimes in Ukraine.) Graffiti of a crossed-out fish is another allusion to Ukraine: *net voine* (no to war) in Russian has a similar number of letters to *net* *voble* (no to salt-cured fish).

“你需要避开审查，而且你知道审查官一直在关注你，”巴黎社会人类学家亚历山德拉·阿尔希波娃解释说。她将这些匿名的俄语符号称为“伊索语言”，这个术语起源于19世纪末。（许多人认为讽刺家米哈伊尔·索尔捷科夫-谢德林使其广为流传，尽管他更喜欢使用“奴隶的语言”这个词组。）

“You need to avoid your censor, and you know that censor is watching you all the time,” explains Alexandra Arkhipova, a social anthropologist in Paris. She refers to these anonymous Russian symbols as “Aesopian language”, a term that originated in the late 19th century. (Many credit Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin, a satirist, for popularising it, though he preferred the phrase “the language of slaves”.)

苏联创建者列宁[弗拉基米尔·列宁](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2016/10/06/missed-connection)憎恶自己不得不使用伊索语言（在他夺取权力并审查别人之前）。1917年，列宁抱怨他得“考虑沙皇审查”，要“极度谨慎，含蓄地，用寓言语言写作——用那该死的伊索言语”。

The Soviet Union’s founding Bolshevik, [Vladimir Lenin](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2016/10/06/missed-connection), resented that he had to use Aesopian language (before he seized power and censored other people). In 1917 Lenin lamented that he wrote “with an eye to the tsarist censorship…with extreme caution, by hints, in an allegorical language—in that accursed Aesopian language”.

最好的情况是在第一时间就不需要编码语言。但隐晦的表达总比没有表达要好。在3月15日至17日举行俄罗斯[虚假选举](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/12/russians-go-to-the-polls-in-a-sham-election-for-their-president)之前，阿尔希波娃博士正在监视政府选举海报。莫斯科最近的一张海报被涂上“纳瓦尔尼”。另一张看起来很正常，印有官方的红蓝白颜色。仔细一看，上面写着“为没有普京的俄罗斯”。■

It would be preferable for coded language not to be needed in the first place. But cloaked expression is better than no expression. Ahead of Russia’s [sham election](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/12/russians-go-to-the-polls-in-a-sham-election-for-their-president) on March 15th-17th, Dr Arkhipova is monitoring government voting posters. A recent one in Moscow had “Navalny” scrawled across it. Another appeared normal, with official red, blue and white. A closer look reveals the phrase “for Russia without Putin”. ■
