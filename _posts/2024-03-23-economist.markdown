本周封面 (This week’s covers)
======================

我们眼中的世界 (How we saw the world)
---------------------------

有些周我们会发布不止一版封面，本周我们关注英国的移民问题。政治人士称移民是一场危机和灾难，但实际记录显示，英国在整合来到其国土的外来人口方面有着世界领先的能力。在其他地方我们展示了以色列即使在军事上占据优势的同时，其长远未来仍受到威胁。

Some weeks, including this one, we publish more than one cover. In Britain we focus on immigration. The politics say that immigration is a crisis and a disaster, but the record says that Britain has a world-beating ability to integrate the people who come to its shores. Everywhere else we illustrate how, even at a moment of military ascendancy, Israel’s long-term future is under threat.

But his exit is fraught with dangers](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/17/deposing-the-king-of-israel)

英国如今外国出生的居民比例比美国还要高，六分之一的居民出生在其他国家。焦虑的政客抱怨说，英国正在接纳来自贫困国家的人做卑微的工作，以及想获得签证仅仅为了送披萨的软弱学生。他们说，多元文化主义已经失败：太多的移民生活在分隔的社区里，过着并行的生活。本周，议会中的政客们就一项法案进行争辩，该法案将使将寻求庇护者送往卢旺达而无需听取他们的请求变得更加容易——这是一系列旨在“阻止船只”的不自由法律中的最新一项。

Britain now has a larger share of foreign-born residents than America. One in six of its inhabitants began life in another country. Angsty politicians gripe that Britain is letting in people from poor countries to do menial jobs, and weak students who want visas only so they can deliver pizzas. Multiculturalism has failed, they say: too many immigrants live parallel lives in segregated neighbourhoods. This week politicians in Parliament tussled over a bill that will make it easier to ship asylum-seekers to Rwanda without hearing their pleas—the latest in a string of illiberal laws designed to “stop the boats”.

令人惊讶的是，英国在经济、社会和文化方面出色地帮助外国人融入。在这方面，至少可以说它是世界的典范。

The surprising thing is that Britain excels at getting foreigners up to speed economically, socially and culturally. It is (in this respect, at least) a model for the rest of the world.

早先有一个想法是寻找一个整合的象征。我们考虑选择一个五彩缤纷的联合旗帜。或许我们没有选择它才是一个好事，因为最近有一场关于新英格兰足球服上印有五彩缤纷圣乔治十字的争论激起了争议。

An early idea was to look for a symbol of integration. We considered choosing a multicoloured union flag. It was probably a good thing that we didn’t go for this, given that a row has flared up about the multicoloured St George’s cross emblazoned on the new England football kit.

我们还考虑到了国饮：茶。如果美国是一个熔炉，加拿大是一个马赛克，也许英国可以被比作一杯加热的建筑工茶。这些茶包来自世界各地——令任何爱喝茶的人感到担忧，其中包括波兰和罗马尼亚。

We also thought of the national drink: tea. If America is a melting pot and Canada is a mosaic perhaps Britain could be a warm brew of builder’s. These tea bags come from around the world—worryingly for any tea drinkers out there, that includes Poland and Romania.

在欧盟中，拥有学位而非仍在接受教育的外国出生成年人的就业率比拥有学位的本地人低十个百分点。而在英国，失业率的差距微乎其微，仅为两个百分点。在英格兰，母语不是英语的青少年比以英语为母语的青少年更有可能在全国普通教育证书考试中获得数学和英语的优异成绩。英国正逐渐分裂为少数民族聚居区的观念是一个谎言。自1991年人口普查开始跟踪以来，每个种族群体的分离程度一直在持续降低。

In the European Union foreign-born adults with degrees who are not still in education have an employment rate ten percentage points lower than natives with degrees. In Britain the gap is a trivial two points. In England teenagers who do not speak English as their first language are more likely to obtain good grades in maths and English in national GCSE exams than native English-speakers. The idea that Britain is dividing into ghettos is a myth. Every ethnic group has consistently become less segregated since the census started keeping track in 1991.

为了包含所有这些，我们需要更宏伟的东西——还有什么比迎接抵达埃利斯岛的移民的巨大雕像更宏伟呢？我们的封面展示了自由女神像栖息在俯瞰英吉利海峡的七姐妹白垩悬崖上。我们曾考虑将大海剪去，这样读者就不会想起那些载运寻求庇护者的小船。毕竟，去年只有不到3万名寻求庇护者到来，而与之相比，截至6月长期移民人数达到了120万人。

To capture all this we needed something with more grandeur—and what could be grander than the colossal statue that greeted immigrants as they arrived at Ellis Island by sea? Our cover shows the Statue of Liberty perched on the Seven Sisters, a stretch of chalk cliff overlooking the English Channel. We considered cutting out the sea, so that readers were not reminded of the armada of small boats carrying asylum-seekers. After all, fewer than 30,000 of them came last year, compared with 1.2m long-term immigrants in the year to June.

然而，那个场景更难理解。七姐妹是一个国家地标，但在图像中却被遮掩。实际上，直面读者所进行的小船是一种优点。庇护问题需要解决，并且它主导了对移民的看法。但它并不能代表真正发生的事情。

And yet that scene was harder to make sense of. The Seven Sisters are a national landmark, but they were lost in the image. And confronting readers with the small boats was, in fact, a virtue. Asylum needs fixing and it dominates perceptions of immigration. But it does not represent what is really going on.

冲击波 (Shockwaves)
-------------

![俄罗斯选民在当地时间中午莫斯科的一个投票站排队等候警方检查](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_WWP001.jpg)

成千上万的**俄罗斯人**利用一场联邦选举[抗议弗拉基米尔·普京](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/17/vladimir-putins-sham-re-election-is-notable-only-for-the-protests)，在投票站排队时勇敢展示反战横幅，默默地在选票上标记亚历克谢·纳瓦尔尼的名字，他是上月在北极刑场去世的反对派领袖。在这次严密控制的选举中，没有任何严肃的反对派人士被允许竞选。总统决定将87%的选票分配给自己，比2018年的虚伪投票多了10个百分点。

Tens of thousands of **Russians** used a federal election to [protest against Vladimir Putin](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/17/vladimir-putins-sham-re-election-is-notable-only-for-the-protests), bravely displaying anti-war banners in queues for polling stations and silently marking their ballots with the name of Alexei Navalny, the opposition leader who died in an Arctic penal colony last month. No serious opponents to Mr Putin were allowed to stand in the tightly managed election. The president decided to allot 87% of the vote to himself, ten percentage points more than in the previous sham poll in 2018.

美国、英国和欧盟谴责俄罗斯当局压制对普京政权的反对。这场选举还在[**乌克兰地区**](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/16/in-occupied-mariupol-russian-invaders-hold-a-sham-election)举行，包括俄罗斯侵略的克里米亚，英国外交大臣卡梅伦勋爵称其“令人憎恶”。中国、印度、伊朗和朝鲜向普京表示祝贺。

America, Britain and the EU condemned the Russian authorities for suppressing opposition to Mr Putin’s regime. The election was also held in the [regions of **Ukraine**](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/16/in-occupied-mariupol-russian-invaders-hold-a-sham-election) that Russia has invaded, including Crimea, which Lord Cameron, the British foreign secretary, described as “abhorrent”. China, India, Iran and North Korea congratulated Mr Putin.

欧盟成员国和欧洲议会达成了一项协议，将**乌克兰商品的进口**自由化延长一年。为了呼应抗议的农民，一些产品，如家禽和燕麦，被加入到了受到保护以免进口泛滥市场商品清单中。小麦和大麦未列入清单。

The European Union’s member states and the European Parliament reached a deal that extends the liberalisation on **imports of Ukrainian goods** for a year. In a nod to protesting farmers, some products, such as poultry and oats, were added to a list of items that are safeguarded against imports flooding the market. Wheat and barley were not on the list.

李奥·瓦拉德卡表示将辞去**爱尔兰**总理职务，这一宣布令他的同胞和自己的副总理都感到惊讶。他表示辞职原因既是个人的又是政治的，但没有透露更多细节，尽管他最近领导的政府在修改宪法方面遭受了重大投票失败。领导执政联盟的Fine Gael将在未来几周内选择一位新领袖。

Leo Varadkar said that he would step down as prime minister of **Ireland**, an announcement that took his countrymen, and his own deputy prime minister, by surprise. He said his reasons were personal and political without giving any further details, though his government recently suffered heavy referendum defeats over altering the constitution. Fine Gael, which heads the governing coalition, will choose a new leader in the coming weeks.

沃恩·盖辛被威尔士议会确认为**威尔士**的新首席部长。他是第一位担任这一职务的黑人。这也是首次，苏格兰、威尔士和北爱尔兰以及英国首相的领导人中没有一位是白人男性。

Vaughan Gething was conﬁrmed as the new ﬁrst minister of **Wales** by the Welsh Parliament. He is the ﬁrst black person to hold the post. For the ﬁrst time none of the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland or the British prime minister is a white male.

美国参议院多数党领袖，也是民主党中**以色列**最坚定支持者之一的[查克·舒默](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/18/binyamin-netanyahu-is-alienating-israels-best-friends)呼吁提前举行选举，称以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡“迷失了方向”。乔·拜登支持这一信息。内塔尼亚胡同意派官员前往华盛顿商讨以色列对拉法赫的入侵计划，而美国总统暗示这是一个“红线”。内塔尼亚胡坚称这次军事行动仍是必要的。

[Chuck Schumer](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/18/binyamin-netanyahu-is-alienating-israels-best-friends), the Senate majority leader in America and one of **Israel’s** staunchest supporters in the Democratic Party, called for early elections, saying that Binyamin Netanyahu, the country’s prime minister, had “lost his way”. Joe Biden endorsed the message. Mr Netanyahu agreed to send officials to Washington to discuss Israel’s plan for an invasion of Rafah—which the American president has suggested is a “red line”. Mr Netanyahu insisted that the offensive was still necessary.

美国国务卿安东尼·布林肯表示，**[加沙人](https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas)**正面临“严重的粮食不安全”，这是首次将整个人口列入这一类别。他正推动以色列优先提供人道主义援助。**以色列军队**再次袭击了加沙北部的阿尔舍法医院。以色列表示，他们瞄准了在那里重新集结的哈马斯官员，尽管以色列声称控制了这一地区。

Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, said that **[Gazans](https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas)** were facing “acute food insecurity” and that it was the first time an entire population had been so classified. He is pushing Israel to prioritise the provision of humanitarian aid. **Israeli forces** again raided al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza. Israel said that it was targeting Hamas officials who had regrouped there, despite Israel’s claim to have control over the area.

美国国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文证实，哈马斯军事部门副指挥官马尔万·伊萨在一次以色列空袭中丧生。自10月7日以来，他是该组织最高级别的领导人。

Jake Sullivan, America’s national security adviser, confirmed that Marwan Issa, the deputy commander of **Hamas’s** military wing, had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. He is the group’s most senior leader to die since October 7th.

**[巴勒斯坦权威](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/21/a-new-leader-offers-little-hope-for-palestinians)**主席马哈茂德·阿巴斯任命穆罕默德·穆斯塔法为新总理。穆斯塔法长期担任阿巴斯的经济顾问。外界希望他能整顿巴勒斯坦权威。

Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the **[Palestinian Authority](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/21/a-new-leader-offers-little-hope-for-palestinians)**, appointed a new prime minister, Mohammad Mustafa. Mr Mustafa has long had a close relationship with Mr Abbas as his economic adviser. Outsiders hope that he will clean up the PA.

尼日尔的军政府撤销了与美国的一项军事协议，根据该协议，约1100名美国军队一直驻扎在该国，帮助打击撒哈拉地区的圣战分子。此前，美国高级外交官告诉军政府，他们对后者与俄罗斯和伊朗日益紧密的联系感到担忧才做出这一决定。

The military junta in **Niger** revoked a military accord with America, under which roughly 1,100 American troops have been based in the country to help fight jihadists in the Sahel. The announcement came after senior American diplomats told the junta they were concerned about its growing ties to Russia and Iran.

![苏丹北达尔富尔埃尔法舍附近Zamzam难民营的一名妇女和婴儿](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_WWP002.jpg)

联合国警告称，由于内战以及冲突双方苏丹军队和快速支援部队阻挠援助运送，**苏丹**有500万人可能面临“灾难性”的饥饿。联合国表示，自去年10月以来，他们一直无法越过战线抵达位于首都喀土穆的部分地区。

The UN warned that 5m people in **Sudan** could face “catastrophic” levels of hunger because of civil war and because both sides in the conflict, the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, are obstructing the delivery of aid. The UN said it has not been able to cross the front lines to reach parts of Khartoum, the capital, since October.

**[唐纳德·特朗普](https://www.economist.com/united-states/article89399-prod.ece)**的律师表示，他无法筹集4.54亿美元支付对他在一起民事诉讼中被判的罚款。特朗普先生因恶意夸大其资产价值而被法官处以罚款。他已要求上诉法院暂缓法官的判决，以便他对此提出上诉。

**[Donald Trump](https://www.economist.com/united-states/article89399-prod.ece)** cannot raise $454m to pay the penalty awarded against him in a civil trial, according to his lawyers. The penalty was handed down by a judge to Mr Trump for fraudulently inflating the value of his assets. He has asked an appeals court to put the judge’s decision on hold while he launches an appeal against it.

彼得·纳瓦罗曾任职于特朗普总统时期的贸易顾问，他因无视国会对1月6日对国会大厦冲击事件进行调查的传票，而开始了为期四个月的监禁。最高法院拒绝了纳瓦罗先生在上诉期间避免监禁的最后一刻辩护。

**Peter Navarro**, a trade adviser to Mr Trump when he was president, began a four-month jail sentence for ignoring a subpoena from Congress in its investigation into the storming of the Capitol on January 6th 2021. The Supreme Court rejected a last-minute plea from Mr Navarro to avoid prison while he appeals against his sentence.

与此同时，特朗普总统的前副总统**迈克·彭斯**表示在良心上无法支持他的前上司第二次竞选总统。彭斯还排除了投票支持乔·拜登的可能性。

Meanwhile, **Mike Pence**, Mr Trump’s vice-president in the White House, said he “could not in good conscience” support his former boss’s second run for the presidency. Mr Pence also ruled out voting for Joe Biden.

去年美国进行了超过100万次**[堕胎手术](https://www.economist.com/united-states/article89340-prod.ece)**，比2020年增加了10%，尽管最高法院在2022年取消了妇女堕胎的宪法保护。对此数据进行整理的古特马赫研究所表示，在那些边界与禁止该程序的14个州接壤的州，堕胎数量激增。例如，伊利诺伊州的堕胎手术增加了72%，新墨西哥州增加了257%。

Over 1m **[abortions](https://www.economist.com/united-states/article89340-prod.ece)** were performed in America last year, 10% more than in 2020 and despite the Supreme Court’s removal of women’s constitutional protections for abortion in 2022. The Guttmacher Institute, which compiled the data, said abortions had surged in states that border the 14 states where the procedure has been banned. Abortions were up by 72% in Illinois and 257% in New Mexico, for example.

**[香港](https://www.economist.com/china/article89490-prod.ece)**通过了一项覆盖暴乱和破坏等行为的新安全法。批评者担心这将被用于打击异见人士。香港当局迅速批准了中国中央政府的要求，后者加紧控制该地区。

**[Hong Kong](https://www.economist.com/china/article89490-prod.ece)** passed a new security law covering acts such as insurrection and sabotage. Critics fear it will be used to target dissidents. The authorities in Hong Kong moved quickly to approve the measure at the behest of China’s central government, which has tightened its grip on the territory.

**越南**执政的共产党强迫总统佛·范·燕辞职。他担任总统职务仅仅一年多，此前他的前任也被同样突然地解职。这次突然的换人似乎与党内反腐运动有关。分析人士担心该运动开始威胁到国家政治稳定，因为竞争的党派利用它来败坏对手的名誉。

**Vietnam’s** ruling Communist Party forced the resignation of Vo Van Thuong as president. He had been in the job a little over a year following the similarly abrupt dismissal of his predecessor. The sudden exit appears related to an anti-corruption drive by the party. Analysts worry that the campaign is beginning to threaten the country’s political stability as competing party factions use it to tarnish rivals.

**新加坡**反对派领袖普里塔姆·辛格对向国会委员会撒谎的两项指控表示不认罪。辛格先生的工人党一直在挑战自1959年以来执政的人民行动党，准备在明年11月之前的选举中交接权力。总理李显龙正准备将总理职位交给副手劳伦斯·黄。

**Singapore’s** opposition leader, Pritam Singh, pleaded not guilty to two charges of lying to a parliamentary committee. Mr Singh’s Workers’ Party has been challenging the People’s Action Party, which has ruled Singapore since 1959, ahead of a planned transition of power. The prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, is preparing to hand over his job to his deputy, Lawrence Wong, before an election that is due by November next year.

**巴西**总统(2019年至2022年) 阿尔·玛·波索纳罗可能面临首次刑事起诉，因警方建议他面临篡改其新冠病毒疫苗接种证明卡的指控，以便于2022年前往美国旅行。波索纳罗坚称自己从未接种过疫苗，并否认对他的记录进行过干预。

Jair Bolsonaro, **Brazil’s** president from 2019 to 2022, could face a criminal indictment for the first time, after police proposed that he face charges of altering his covid-certification card to say he’d had a vaccine in order to travel to America in 2022. Mr Bolsonaro insists he has never had the jab and denies any knowledge of his records being interfered with.

世界气象组织证实，2023年是有史以来**最温暖的一年**，全球平均地表温度比工业化前升高了1.45摄氏度。联合国机构列举了更温暖世界的一些影响：全球平均海平面达到历史新高，南极海冰的范围达到了历史绝对低点，粮食不安全加剧。

The World Meteorological Organisation confirmed that 2023 was the **warmest year on record**, with the average global surface temperature at 1.450C above pre-industrial levels. The UN agency listed some of the effects of a warmer world: the global mean sea level reached a record high, the extent of Antarctic sea ice hit a record absolute low and food insecurity has increased.

一条崎岖之路 (A rocky road)
------------------

![A person stands in front of an electronic stock board showing Japan's Nikkei 225 index at a securities firm Monday, March 18, 2024, in Tokyo. ](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_WWP501.jpg)

一个人站在东京某证券公司，显示着2024年3月18日周一日本日经225指数的电子股票板前的照片。

The **[Bank of Japan](https://www.economist.com/leaders/article89386-prod.ece)** raised interest rates for the first time since 2007. The target rate for overnight loans was raised from between minus 0.1% and zero to between zero and 0.1%, making the BoJ the last central bank to end a negative- interest-rate policy (it first took rates below zero in 2016). The bank also ditched its yield-curve controls, which capped the yields on long-term government bonds. The change in direction had been signalled for months, but Ueda Kazuo, the bank’s governor, said it would maintain “accommodative financial conditions”. The bank will still buy about ¥6trn ($40bn) a month in government bonds.

**日本银行（Bank of Japan）**自2007年以来首次上调了利率。隔夜贷款目标利率从-0.1%至0之间提高到0至0.1%之间，这使得日本银行成为最后一个结束负利率政策的央行（它最早是在2016年将利率降至零以下）。该银行还放弃了对长期政府债券收益率的控制。数月前就已暗示改变方向，但该行行长植田和男表示它将保持“宽松的金融条件”。该银行仍将每月购买约6万亿日元（400亿美元）的政府债券。

The **[Federal Reserve](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/article89650-prod.ece)** left rates unchanged at its meeting. Investors were more interested in the Fed’s “dot plot” of the path for interest rates, which suggested that it still expects to make three quarter-point cuts this year. Markets soared.

**美联储（Federal Reserve）**在会议上将利率保持不变。投资者更关心美联储对于利率路径的“点阵图”，该图表明它仍预计今年将进行三次0.25%的降息。市场大幅上涨。

In a busy week for big central banks, the **Bank of England** also met and kept interest rates on hold. Meanwhile, Britain’s annual inflation rate fell to 3.4% in February, from 4% in January.

在大型央行繁忙的一周中，**英格兰银行**也开会并将利率保持不变。与此同时，英国2月份的年通胀率从1月的4%降至3.4%。

**Reddit** priced its shares at $34 ahead of its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, the top end of the price range it had submitted to investors. The social-media platform’s IPO was heavily oversubscribed.

**Reddit**在纽约证券交易所上市首日将其股票定价为34美元，处于提交给投资者的价格范围的最高端。这家社交媒体平台的首次公开募股备受超额认购。

After years of fighting his extradition from Britain and ten months under house arrest, **Mike Lynch** went on trial in San Francisco over claims that he fraudulently misstated revenues at Autonomy, a software firm that he sold to Hewlett-Packard in 2011 for $10.3bn. HP subsequently took a huge write-down on the value of its acquisition and alleged that Mr Lynch, Autonomy’s founder, had deceived the company. The prosecution says it is the biggest case of fraud in Silicon Valley’s history. Mr Lynch denies the charge. His defence counters that HP mismanaged Autonomy.

在英国与引渡长期抗争并被软禁10个月后，**迈克·林奇（Mike Lynch）**在旧金山接受审判，被控在2011年将创立的软件公司Autonomy以103亿美元出售给惠普时故意虚报收入。惠普随后对其收购价值进行巨额减记，并声称林奇先生是Autonomy的创始人，欺骗了公司。检方表示这是硅谷历史上最大的欺诈案。林奇先生否认指控。他的辩护意见称惠普管理Autonomy得不善。

Under pressure from activist investors, **Unilever** set out a restructuring plan that could see it shed 7,500 jobs, about 6% of its workforce. The consumer-goods conglomerate is also spinning off its ice-cream division, which includes the Magnum and Ben & Jerry’s brands. Ice-cream accounts for 16% of Unilever’s sales, but prospects for the business’s growth are melting.

在**联合利华（Unilever）**受到激进投资者压力的情况下，其制定了一个重组计划，可能导致其削减7500个工作岗位，约占其总员工人数的6%。这家消费品集团还将其冰淇淋部门剥离出去，其中包括Magnum和Ben & Jerry's品牌。冰淇淋占联合利华销售额的16%，但该业务增长前景黯淡。

**Apple** reached a $490m settlement over claims that it misled investors in 2018 about strong demand for the iPhone in China.

The Biden administration unveiled sweeping new **vehicle-pollution rules** which it hopes will ensure that most new cars and light trucks sold in America are either pure-electric or hybrid by 2032. The new standards require carmakers to raise caps gradually on the amount of exhaust-pipe pollution their vehicles emit, but it does not ban them. The regulations come amid a weakening demand for EVs in America, and will probably be challenged all the way to the Supreme Court.

拜登政府发布了广泛的**汽车排放规定**，希望确保2032年在美国销售的大多数新车和轻型卡车要么是纯电动车，要么是混合动力车。新标准要求汽车制造商逐渐提高车辆排放的上限，但并未禁止排放。这些规定出台时，美国对电动汽车的需求疲软，可能会一直挑战到最高法院。

美国最高法院应拒绝对堕胎药物的挑战 (America’s Supreme Court should reject the challenge to abortion drugs)
======================================================================================

邮购米非司酮的案件在法律和医学上都站不住脚 (The case against mail-order mifepristone is legally and medically spurious)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![A sheet of pills and an envelope with a flower symbol on the stamp](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_LDD003.jpg)

美国妇女据信今天比2022年最高法院推翻《罗伊诉韦德案》之前做了更多的堕胎。主要原因可能是**堕胎药**。安全有效、便宜便利，而且足够小，可以装进信封，使许多妇女能够在家里进行堕胎。这些药物在美国堕胎数量中占据近三分之二，从2011年的近四分之一上升，部分原因是食品药物管理局（FDA）放宽了其使用和分发规则。难怪反对堕胎的人希望最高法院对其进行限制。从医学和法律上看，那将是一个错误。

AMERICAN WOMEN are thought to have more abortions today than they did before the Supreme Court overturned *Roe v Wade* in 2022. The main reason is probably [abortion pills](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/19/fewer-states-allow-abortions-yet-american-women-are-having-more). Safe and effective, cheap and convenient, and small enough to fit into an envelope, they enable many women to have an abortion without leaving home. The pills account for nearly two-thirds of terminations in America, up from almost a quarter in 2011, partly because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has loosened rules around their use and distribution. No wonder pro-lifers want the Supreme Court to clamp down on them. Medically and legally, that would be an error.

法院将于3月26日审理该案-- 这是自废除《罗伊诉韦德案》以来，掀起全国性关于生殖权争论的首次审理。作为保守派团体，希波克拉底医药联盟希望对**米非司酮**（一种通常与另一种米索前列醇联合使用的药物，用于引产）进行更严格的限制。该团体主张，食品药品监督管理局的裁决是“武断”的，并且要恢复对**米非司酮**使用的严格限制，例如七周限制，以及仅有医生可以进行处方和提供（必须面对面）的要求。

The court will hear the case on March 26th—its first on abortion since it ignited a nationwide battle over reproductive rights by scrapping *Roe*. The Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, a conservative group, wants greater restrictions around mifepristone, a drug typically used in combination with another, misoprostol, to induce abortions. Arguing that the FDA’s rulings have been “arbitrary” and “capricious”, it wants to restore a strict seven-week limit on use of mifepristone, as well as a requirement that only doctors can prescribe and provide it—and that this must be in person.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_LDC009.png)

这对妇女健康来说将是一个糟糕的结局。**米非司酮**比泰诺更安全，比后期手术引产并发症更少。相比手术，它的价格更为便宜、侵入性更小、更为方便，特别是对于无法轻易前往诊所的妇女或通过远程医疗处方时。基于药物的堕胎在全球范围内增加。在英格兰、威尔士和北欧的大部分地区，约90％的堕胎现在使用药物。在受到限制造访医生的疫情期间，试验发现远程开具**堕胎药**处方具有许多好处，没有额外风险。

That would be a bad outcome for women’s health. Mifepristone is safer than Tylenol (paracetamol) and has fewer complications than later-stage surgical abortion. It is also cheaper, less invasive and more convenient than surgery, especially for women who cannot easily get to a clinic or when prescribed through telemedicine. Pill-based abortion has risen globally. In England and Wales, and much of Scandinavia, around 90% of terminations now use pills. During the pandemic, which limited visits to doctors, trials found that remote prescriptions of abortion pills have many benefits and no added risk.

将**米非司酮**的使用限制到怀孕七周内在医学上毫无意义。如果说什么的话，FDA目前为止的十周限制太过严格。世界卫生组织将**米非司酮**列为在怀孕12周内进行堕胎的安全有效药物。尽管今天的妇女比过去更容易发现和终止怀孕，但美国49%的堕胎仍发生在怀孕6至12周之间（94%在第一季度发生）。如果没有**米非司酮**，这些妇女中的大部分仍将进行堕胎，使用的可能是仅有**米索前列醇**的药物或手术。但这些选择往往导致更多的麻烦、不适和更高的额外医疗干预风险。

Restricting mifepristone’s use to seven weeks of pregnancy makes no sense medically. If anything, the FDA’s current ten-week limit is too restrictive. The World Health Organisation lists mifepristone as safe and effective for abortions up to 12 weeks. Although women now detect and terminate pregnancies earlier than in the past, 49% of abortions in America still happen between six and 12 weeks (94% take place in the first trimester). Without mifepristone, most of these women will still have abortions, using either misoprostol alone or surgery. But these options tend to bring more hassle, discomfort and a higher risk of further medical intervention.

支持原告将会是一个糟糕的法律结局。法院应当有充分理由认为监管机构的技术评估是错误的。如果法官可以替代FDA来做出自己的所谓专业评估，那将削弱美国基于技术的监管制度--尤其是如果测试案例是一个在经验证据充分且原告没有遭受具体伤害的有争议问题时。任何人都可以因着有理由的对避孕药的道德反对或对COVID-19疫苗的阴谋论而起诉FDA。对其他机构的无根据的挑战也会增加。

Siding with the plaintiffs would also be a bad legal outcome. Courts should require strong grounds to conclude that a regulator has got a technical assessment wrong. If judges can substitute their own supposed expertise for the FDA’s, it will weaken America’s system of technically informed regulation—especially if the test case is a charged issue in which the empirical evidence is strong and the plaintiff has suffered no concrete injury. Anyone with a cause, from moral objections to contraceptives to conspiracy theories about covid-19 jabs, will be encouraged to sue the FDA. Meritless challenges against other agencies will proliferate, too.

这个案例为法官们限制司法激进主义提供了机会。我们希望最高法院主要因为这个原因而进行审理。通过全体一致支持FDA，最高法院能够以最佳方式这样做。 ■

This case presents an opportunity for the justices to rein in judicial activism. Our hope is that the Supreme Court took it on chiefly for that reason. It can best do so by coming down unanimously in favour of the FDA. ■



<hr><span style="color: red;"><b>领导人 | 加沙及更远地区的战争</b></span> (Leaders | The war in Gaza and beyond)

在军事实力强大的时刻，以色列显得非常脆弱 (At a moment of military might, Israel looks deeply vulnerable)
=================================================================================

美国应帮助它找到更好的策略 (America should help it find a better strategy)
----------------------------------------------------------

![以色列国旗在沙尘暴中飘扬](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_LDD002_FH.jpg)

加沙地狱般的情境中仍有一条狭窄的出路。一次**暂时性停火**和人质释放可能会导致以色列政府的变化；南加沙剩余的哈马斯武装分子可能会被遏制或消失；并且在废墟之中，以美国及其海湾盟友提供支持下，围绕着**两国方案**的谈判可能会开始。然而同样有可能的是，停火谈判会失败。这可能使以色列深陷其75年历史中最为黯淡的轨迹，包括无休止的占领、**极右翼政治**和孤立。今天，许多以色列人对此还视而不见，但政治上的清算最终将会到来。它将决定巴勒斯坦人的命运，也将决定以色列在未来75年中是否能茁壮发展。

There is still a narrow path out of the hellscape of Gaza. A temporary ceasefire and hostage release could cause a change of Israel’s government; the rump of Hamas fighters in south Gaza could be contained or fade away; and from the rubble, talks on a two-state solution could begin, underwritten by America and its Gulf allies. It is just as likely, however, that ceasefire talks will fail. That could leave Israel locked in the bleakest trajectory of its 75-year existence, featuring endless occupation, hard-right politics and isolation. Today many Israelis are in denial about this, but a political reckoning will come eventually. It will determine not only the fate of Palestinians, but also whether Israel thrives in the next 75 years.

如果你是以色列的朋友，那么此刻可能是非常尴尬的时刻。今年10月，以色列对哈马斯发动了正当的自卫战争，而哈马斯的恐怖分子曾经犯下暴行，威胁到以色列作为一个犹太人安全之地的理念。如今，以色列已经摧毁了哈马斯的力量，也许占其一半。但在某些重要方面，[其任务却失败了](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/03/21/the-war-in-gaza-may-topple-hamas-without-making-israel-safer)。

If you are a friend of Israel this is a deeply uncomfortable moment. In October it launched a justified war of self-defence against Hamas, whose terrorists had committed atrocities that threaten the idea of Israel as a land where Jews are safe. Today Israel has destroyed perhaps half of Hamas’s forces. But in important ways [its mission has failed](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/03/21/the-war-in-gaza-may-topple-hamas-without-making-israel-safer).

[*阅读我们对以色列和哈马斯之间战争的所有报道*](https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas)

[*Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas*](https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas)

首先，在加沙，以色列不愿提供或分发援助导致了一个可以避免的人道主义灾难，战争造成的平民死亡人数已超过2万人并持续增长。本雅明•内塔尼亚胡（Binyamin Netanyahu）领导下的**极右派政府**拒绝了有关战后加沙由巴勒斯坦权力机构（**pa**）或国际部队管理的计划。最有可能的结果是军事重新占领。如果再加上约旦河西岸，以色列可能永久性地控制着400万至500万巴勒斯坦人。

First, in Gaza, where its reluctance to help provide or distribute aid has led to an avoidable humanitarian catastrophe, and where the civilian toll from the war is over 20,000 and growing. The hard-right government of Binyamin Netanyahu has rejected plans for post-war Gaza to be run by either the Palestinian Authority (pa) or an international force. The likeliest outcome is a military reoccupation. If you add the West Bank, Israel could permanently hold sway over 4m-5m Palestinians.

以色列也在国内失败了。问题不仅仅是内塔尼亚胡糟糕的领导。日益增长的定居者运动和极端正统派人口使政治向右倾斜并导致了社会分裂。10月7日之前，这在一场围绕司法独立的斗争中显而易见。这场战争提高了赌注，虽然联合政府中的**极右翼政党**被排除在战争内阁之外，但他们却通过煽动性言论、煽动定居者暴力和企图破坏援助和战后规划,已经危及了以色列的国家利益。以色列的安全机构是有能力且务实的，但已不再完全掌控着局面。

Israel has also failed at home. The problems go deeper than Mr Netanyahu’s dire leadership. A growing settler movement and ultra-Orthodox population have tilted politics to the right and polarised society. Before October 7th this was visible in a struggle over judicial independence. The war has raised the stakes, and although the hard-right parties of the coalition are excluded from the war cabinet they have compromised Israel’s national interest by using incendiary rhetoric, stoking settler violence and trying to sabotage aid and post-war planning. Israel’s security establishment is capable and pragmatic, but no longer fully in charge.

以色列最终的失败在于笨拙的外交。对这场战争的愤怒是不可避免的，尤其是在全球南方，但以色列在应对上做得并不好。所谓的“法律战争”，包括毫无依据的种族灭绝指控，正在损害其声誉。年轻的美国人对以色列的同情比起他们的父母来说更少。乔•拜登总统试图通过公开支持来控制内塔尼亚胡政府，但未能成功。3月14日，以色列在参议院的最大盟友[查克•舒默](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/18/binyamin-netanyahu-is-alienating-israels-best-friends)谴责了哈马斯的暴行，但表示以色列领导人是“迷失了的”。

Israel’s final failure is clumsy diplomacy. Fury at the war was inevitable, especially in the global south, but Israel has done a poor job of countering it. “Lawfare”, including spurious genocide allegations, is damaging its reputation. Young Americans sympathise with it less than their parents do. President Joe Biden has tried to restrain Mr Netanyahu’s government by publicly embracing it, but failed. On March 14th [Chuck Schumer](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/18/binyamin-netanyahu-is-alienating-israels-best-friends), Israel’s greatest ally in the Senate, decried Hamas’s atrocities but said Israel’s leader was “lost”.

这幅画面在耶路撒冷或特拉维夫并不总是被承认。内塔尼亚胡谈论着入侵拉法，哈马斯最后的据点，而极右派则幻想着重新安置加沙。许多主流以色列人也自欺欺人。他们相信对以色列的独特威胁使得其无情合理化，并且认为这场战争有助于恢复威慑力。然而加沙的情况表明，如果你谋害以色列人，毁灭将降临。很多人认为没有和平伙伴——**巴勒斯坦权力机构已经腐败**，民意调查显示93%的巴勒斯坦人否认哈马斯犯下的暴行。他们得出的结论是占领是最不糟糕的选择。以色列人更希望在国外受欢迎，但谴责和反犹主义是为了安全所付出的微不足道的代价。至于美国，之前已对此表示过愤怒。这种关系不会中断。如果唐纳德•特朗普重返总统职位，他可能再次给以色列一个不受限制的通行证。

It is a bleak picture that is not always acknowledged in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. Mr Netanyahu talks of invading Rafah, Hamas’s last redoubt, while the hard right fantasises about resettling Gaza. Many mainstream Israelis are deluding themselves, too. They believe the unique threats to Israel justify its ruthlessness and that the war has helped restore deterrence. Gaza shows that if you murder Israelis, destruction beckons. Many see no partner for peace—the pa is rotten and polls say 93% of Palestinians deny Hamas’s atrocities even took place. Occupation is the least-bad option, they conclude. Israelis would prefer to be popular abroad, but condemnation and antisemitism are a small price to pay for security. As for America, it has been angry before. The relationship is not about to rupture. If Donald Trump returns he may once again give Israel a free pass.

这个迷人的故事是一场灾难的宣言。考虑国防。对以色列声誉造成的损害可能会使其更难在加沙持续作战。长期威胁来自伊朗及其代理人，包括真主党。阻吓这一威胁需要与美国的军事合作，这需要**跨党派支持**，理想情况下还需要海湾阿拉伯国家的支持。以色列的经济依赖于技术出口和能够进入全球市场的专家。而不是使以色列人安全，永久占领政治上可能会导致**繁殖巴勒斯坦的激进主义**，**笃信犹太民族主义**并对经济构成法律上的威胁。随着与西方的疏远加深，威慑力可能会减弱。企业可能会被列入**黑名单**。老板们可能会将高科技企业搬到国外或者如果是预备役军人，他们可能会在那里被逮捕。

This seductive story is a manifesto for disaster. Consider defence. The damage to Israel’s reputation could make it harder to fight on in Gaza. The long-term threat is from Iran and its proxies, including Hizbullah. Deterring this requires a military partnership with America that needs bipartisan backing, and ideally Gulf Arab support, too. The economy depends on tech exports and experts with access to global markets. And rather than making Israelis safe, permanent occupation poisons politics by emboldening the hard right and breeding Palestinian radicalism. Israelis are right that they have no partner for peace today, but they are best placed to break the cycle.

美国必须帮助以色列避免这种命运——如果失败，将自己付出沉重的外交代价。最好是实现**暂时性停火**，为**两国谈判**开辟道路。若没有这一点，美国政策将需要重新设定。拜登总统早期的拥护失败了，但强迫也会失败。如果美国试图在哈马斯仍有可能重新组织之时强迫以色列撤出加沙，或削减军事支持，或在联合国撤销支持，那么以色列的安全可能会受到威胁。

Israel’s trajectory will intensify its ethno-nationalist politics and pose legal threats to the economy. As estrangement from the West deepens, so deterrence may weaken. Firms could be blacklisted. Bosses could move high-tech businesses abroad or, if they are reservists, be arrested there.

因此，美国应采取其他手段。它应该单方面提供更多的人道主义援助，并拒绝为入侵拉法提供武器，考虑到缺乏对平民的保障。它应该扩大对定居者和右翼极端分子的制裁，以向以色列选民表明美国支持他们的安全，但不支持极端主义或永久占领。它还应继续发出信号，表明自己热衷于承认巴勒斯坦作为**两国**和平谈判的一部分。

America must help Israel avoid that fate—and if it fails it will itself pay a heavy diplomatic price. Best would be a temporary ceasefire, opening a route to two-state talks. Without this, American policy will need resetting. Mr Biden’s early embrace has failed, but so would coercion. If America tried to force Israel out of Gaza while Hamas could still regroup, or curbed military support, or withdrew its support at the un, Israel’s security could be in jeopardy.

然而，美国能做的也只有这么多。大多数以色列战争之后都会引发政治动荡。[罢免内塔尼亚胡](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/17/deposing-israels-king)不会轻而易举。但当清算到来时，它将是巨大的。这场战争打破了许多幻想：忽视巴勒斯坦人是不可取的；巴勒斯坦权力机构对改革没有任何兴趣；反犹主义并不罕见；以色列无法单凭言辞支持两国方案而扩大定居点；以及极右翼无法受到驯服。好消息是仍有希望。民意调查显示，以色列的中间派也许占据了50-60%的选票，诸如最高法院这样的机构仍然强大，也有更好的领导者存在。以色列的未来之路充满了挑战。加沙的战斗只是开始。■

America should therefore use other means. It should dispense more humanitarian aid unilaterally and decline to supply weapons for an invasion of Rafah, given the lack of civilian provision. It should broaden sanctions against settlers and right-wing fanatics to show Israeli voters that America underwrites their security but not extremism or permanent occupation. And it should continue to signal that it is keen to recognise Palestine as part of a two-state peace negotiation.

America, however, can do only so much. Most Israeli wars are followed by political upheaval. [Removing Mr Netanyahu](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/17/deposing-israels-king) will not be easy. But when the reckoning comes it will be huge. The war has shattered many illusions: that the Palestinians can be ignored; that the pa has any appetite for reform; that antisemitism is rare; that Israel can pay lip-service to two states as settlements expand; and that the hard right can be tamed. The good news is that there are grounds for hope. Polls suggest that centrists in Israel command perhaps 50-60% of votes, institutions like the Supreme Court are still strong and better leaders exist. A struggle for Israel’s future awaits. The battle in Gaza is just the start.■

拜登钢铁保护主义的隐藏成本 (The hidden costs of Biden’s steel protectionism)
============================================================

不确定的政治利益不能证明总统否决日本接管美国钢铁的理由 (Uncertain political benefits do not justify the president’s vetoing a Japanese takeover of US Steel)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![宾夕法尼亚州克莱顿市的美国联合钢铁蒙谷工厂](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_LDP503.jpg)

自去年12月爆出日本竞争对手新日铁公司收购标志性工业企业美国联合钢铁的消息以来，反对者们纷纷排队谴责这宗交易。3月14日，乔 · 拜登加入了谴责的行列，称这家企业被国内持有是“至关重要”的。他说：“我告诉我们的钢铁工人，我支持他们，我是认真的。” 其他人，包括工会，认为美国持有是保护本地就业和投资的最佳途径。自由贸易者正确地质疑这些主张，但即使是他们也可能出于政治原因接受经济上不合理的想法。如果阻止这宗交易有助于拜登赢得关键的摇摆州，并因此阻止唐纳德 · 特朗普重返白宫，那对美国和世界来说肯定更好了吧？

Ever since news broke in December of the acquisition of US Steel, an iconic industrial firm, by Nippon Steel, a Japanese competitor, opponents have lined up to condemn the deal. On March 14th Joe Biden joined the chorus, saying that it was “vital” for the business to be domestically owned. “I told our steelworkers I have their backs,” he said, “and I meant it.” Others, including trade unions, see American ownership as the best way to preserve local jobs and investment. Free-traders rightly dispute such claims, but even they might accept an economically unsound idea for political reasons. If blocking the deal helps Mr Biden win crucial swing states and thus keeps Donald Trump from returning to the White House, surely that would be better for America and the world?

考虑一下利害关系。特朗普强烈暗示他会将乌克兰置于俄罗斯入侵者的手中，背叛民主并破坏西方安全。他拒绝接受2020年的选举失败，并威胁对国内的敌人进行“报复”。他也比拜登更加保护主义。他在一月就排除了新日铁的交易，并提议对所有进口商品征收10％的全面关税。拜登的政策很可能会在宾夕法尼亚州（美国联合钢铁公司的总部）等摇摆州的激烈竞争中获得选票，或者在密歇根州，他在谴责这项交易的当天竞选。 这甚至可能是胜利和失败之间的决定性差距。

Consider the stakes. Mr Trump has strongly hinted that he would abandon Ukraine to its Russian invaders, betraying a democracy and undermining the security of the West. He refused to accept electoral defeat in 2020, and has threatened “retribution” against his enemies at home. He is also much more protectionist than Mr Biden. He ruled out the Nippon deal in January, and has proposed a 10% blanket tariff on all imports. Mr Biden’s policy will probably win him votes in close races in Pennsylvania, where US Steel is based, or in Michigan, where he campaigned on the day he denounced the deal. It could even be the difference between victory and defeat.

乍看之下，这似乎是阻止这宗钢铁合并的坚定理由。但是退一步看，这个论点就不那么清晰了。成本比阻止者想象的要高，好处也更不确定。此外，在一场如刀刃般尖锐的竞选中，类似对手和手段的主张可以用来为几乎任何政策辩护，不管有多糟糕。

On the face of it, that presents an ironclad case for blocking the steel merger. Take a step back, though, and the argument is less clear. The costs are greater than the deal-blockers imagine and the benefits are more uncertain. What is more, in a knife-edge campaign similar claims about ends and means can be used to justify pretty much any policy, however bad.

阻止钢铁交易的成本很高。限制资本的自由流动意味着钢铁生产效率降低，最终将导致消费者价格上涨。此外，新日铁承诺不裁员，并计划增加投资。如果是这样，对本地经济的担忧是不合适的。这项交易甚至有可能使美国联合钢铁更加强大。

The costs of blocking the steel deal are stiff. Curbing the free flow of capital means less efficient steel production and ultimately higher prices for consumers. Moreover, Nippon has promised not to cut jobs and plans to increase investment. If so, concerns about the local economy are misplaced. The deal could even end up making US Steel stronger.

更糟糕的是，拜登做出决定的方式是不合理的。他曾承诺要保护一片“小园区”，设个“高围墙”，制定清晰规则让外国投资者知道哪些资产因国家安全而不可触及，同时让自由市场在其他领域运作。然而，即便美国外国投资委员会（cfius）仍在考虑这项交易是否存在安全风险，他仍对这宗钢铁交易发表评论。这样做，他传递了规则是可以打破的信号。外国投资者将担心这片小区域会变得更大。许多美国公司将更多地寻求保护。

Worse, the way in which Mr Biden reached his decision was arbitrary. He had promised to guard a “small yard” with a “high fence”, with clear rules to let foreign investors know what sorts of assets are off-limits for reasons of national security, while allowing free markets to operate everywhere else. Yet he commented on the steel deal even as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (cfius) was still mulling whether it posed a security risk. By doing so, he signalled that the rules are there to be broken. Foreign investors will fear that there is little to stop that small yard getting bigger. Many more American firms will demand protection.

与其增强国家安全性，拜登反而削弱了它。就在宣布这笔交易的几天前，立法者们正提议将日本列入一个绕过最严格CFIUS规定的白名单。现在美国显得专横而反复无常。美国联合钢铁绝不像抖音，上周众议院投票禁止其在美国运营，除非其中国所有者出售。一个是可以受到敌对势力影响的媒体巨头，而另一个是一家中等规模的制造商，正被美国最亲密的盟友之一收购。

Far from bolstering national security, Mr Biden has undermined it. Only days before the deal was announced, lawmakers were proposing to add Japan to a whitelist that bypasses the most stringent CFIUS rules. Now America looks high-handed and fickle. US Steel is nothing like TikTok, which the House of Representatives voted last week to ban in America unless its Chinese owner sells up. One is a media giant open to influence from a hostile power. The other is a medium-sized manufacturer that is being bought by one of America’s closest allies.

即使全面考虑了这些成本——考虑到他日益保护主义的言论，有充分理由怀疑拜登是否会这样做——禁止一宗钢铁收购可能是合理的，因为政治利益是如此明显。问题在于他们很难预测。任何因素都可能影响选举结果。第三方可能会更加突出。更多选民可能会注意到美国经济的良好表现，并对拜登感到满意。在如此激烈、充满不确定性的竞争中，任何单一干预是否足以为他带来渴望的决定性选举利益，目前还无法确定。这就是为什么一次干预导致下一次干预。

Even if you fully count these costs—and, given his increasingly protectionist rhetoric, there is every reason to doubt that Mr Biden has—banning a steel acquisition might make sense because the political benefits are so clear. The trouble is that they are hard to game out. Any number of factors could affect the election. Third parties may gain more prominence. More voters may notice how well America’s economy is doing, and warm to Mr Biden. In a very close race with so much uncertainty, it is anyone’s guess whether any single intervention will be enough to yield him the decisive electoral benefit he craves. That’s why one intervention leads to the next.

出于良好的原因而做坏事是政治中最古老的圈套。拜登会因为赢得这个或那个摇摆州选民群体的支持而采取多少更加武断和不明智的政策？每个行业及其工人都希望获得更多补贴和新规则以限制对手。每次成本增加，先例增多。拜登应谨防最终毒害其胜利。■

Doing bad things for good reasons is the oldest trap in politics. How many more arbitrary and unwise policies will Mr Biden adopt in the hope of winning over this or that group of swing-state voters? Every industry and its workers would like more handouts and new rules to hobble their rivals. Every time the costs mount and the precedents multiply. Mr Biden should beware lest he end up poisoning his own victory. ■

英国是欧洲最适合移民的地方 (Britain is the best place in Europe to be an immigrant)
===================================================================

其他国家可以从其经验中学到什么 (What other countries can learn from its example)
--------------------------------------------------------------

![多佛尔白崖上的自由女神像](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_LDD001_FH.jpg)

认为英国是一个移民国家的概念可能看起来有悖常理。2016年，英国公民在被承诺进一步限制来自欧洲的人口流入后，投票决定退出欧洲联盟。本周，议会内的政治人物就一项法案进行激烈争吵，该法案将使将寻求庇护者运往卢旺达，并且在不听取他们的恳求的情况下变得更加容易――这是一系列旨在“制止船只”设计的不自由法律中的最新一次。

The idea of Britain as a nation of immigration might seem counterintuitive. Its citizens voted to leave the European Union in 2016 after they were promised a tighter chokehold on inflows of people from Europe. This week politicians in Parliament tussled over a bill that will make it easier to ship asylum-seekers to Rwanda without hearing their pleas—the latest in a string of illiberal laws designed to “stop the boats”.

英国也没有对自己拥有的移民群体进行吹嘘。其他地方设有壮丽的移民博物馆；纽约港口的那座博物馆每年吸引数百万游客。英国的小型移民博物馆并非由国家创立，而是由一些值得尊敬的人士创办，坐落在伦敦南部的Lewisham购物中心内，挨着一家折扣商店和一家鞋店。

Neither does the country crow about the migrants it has. Other places have grand immigration museums; the one in New York harbour draws millions of tourists each year. Britain’s small Migration Museum, which was founded not by the state but by some worthies, sits in Lewisham Shopping Centre in south London, between a discount store and a shoe shop.

然而，如今英国的外国出生居民比例却高于美国。六分之一的居民在另一个国家开始了人生。这一比例正在上升，因为尽管英国竭力制止船只的流入，保守党政府却向工人、学生以及如香港人和乌克兰人这样的特定独裁受害者敞开了大门。在人数上，庇护问题只是一个次要事件。去年，跨过英吉利海峡的人数不到3万。长期移民在截至2023年6月的一年内达到了120万。

Yet Britain now has a larger share of foreign-born residents than America. One in six of its inhabitants began life in another country. The share is rising because, even as it strains to stop the boats, the Conservative government has opened the door to workers, students and selected victims of authoritarianism such as Hong Kongers and Ukrainians. Asylum is a sideshow in terms of the numbers. Fewer than 30,000 people floated across the English Channel last year. Long-term immigration in the year to June 2023 stood at 1.2m.

更令人惊讶的是，这个国家在融入移民方面的能力如此出色。焦虑的政治家抱怨说，英国正在让来自贫困国家的人从事琐碎工作，并让想要签证只为能够送披萨的弱势学生入境。他们声称多元文化主义已经失败：太多移民在隔离的社区里过着并行生活。这是胡说八道：英国在经济、社会和文化方面都擅长帮助外国人适应。在这方面，至少可以说它是世界的榜样。

More surprising still is the fact that the country is so good at assimilating immigrants. Angsty politicians gripe that Britain is letting in people from poor countries to do menial jobs, and weak students who want visas only so they can deliver pizzas. Multiculturalism has failed, they say: too many immigrants live parallel lives in segregated neighbourhoods. Nonsense: Britain excels at getting foreigners up to speed economically, socially and culturally. It is (in this respect, at least) a model for the rest of the world.

在许多国家，即使是有技能的移民也难以找到工作。在欧盟，具有学位但不再接受教育的外国出生成年人的就业率比具有学位的本地出生成年人低10个百分点。而在英国，这一差距微不足道，受过少量教育的外国出生人口比其英国出生的同龄人多12个百分点。

In many countries even skilled immigrants struggle to find jobs. In the eu foreign-born adults with degrees who are not still in education have an employment rate ten percentage points lower than natives with degrees. In Britain the gap is a trivial two points, and scantily educated foreign-born people are 12 points more likely to work than their British-born peers.

即使被困在枯燥工作中的移民也知道，他们的孩子通常在学校表现良好。在英格兰，非英语为母语的青少年更有可能在全国的中学毕业考试中获得数学和英语的优异成绩，而不是英语为母语的学生。由富裕国家俱乐部oeCD进行的pISA测试显示，许多欧洲国家的移民和他们的孩子在许多方面表现不佳。在德国，移民的孩子在最新一轮数学测试中得分为436分，而本地出生人口为495分。而在英国，他们的表现略好于本地出生人口。

Even immigrants stuck in dull jobs know that their children tend to fare well in school. In England teenagers who do not speak English as their first language are more likely to obtain good grades in maths and English in national gcse exams than native English-speakers. The pisa tests run by the oecd, a rich-country club, show that immigrants and their children perform badly in much of Europe. In Germany immigrants’ children scored 436 points in the latest maths test, against 495 for natives. In Britain they did slightly better than natives.

英国正变成街区隔离的神话。自从人口普查始于1991年以来，每个种族群体都在不断减少隔离程度。外国出生人口增长最快的地方并不是传统的熔炉，比如伯明翰和伦敦市中心，而是在老旧郊区和小城镇。甚至在这些小城镇内部，**外国人并没有聚集在一起**。

The idea that Britain is dividing into ghettos is a myth. Every ethnic group has consistently become less segregated since the census started keeping track in 1991. The foreign-born population is growing fastest not in traditional melting-pots such as Birmingham and inner London but in staid suburbs and smallish towns. Even within those towns, [foreigners do not cluster together](https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/03/18/without-realising-it-britain-has-become-a-nation-of-immigrants).

移民仍然是激烈政治辩论的话题。但这可能是因为那些真正不喜欢移民的人愿意仅根据这个问题做出投票决定。总体而言，自英国脱欧以来，英国人变得更加放松。他们似乎对最近的一项引人注目的发展并不介意。英国、苏格兰和伦敦的最高政治职位都由移民子女――所有人都是南亚裔――担任。北爱尔兰和威尔士的首席部长出生在国外（尽管米歇尔·奥尼尔只是从爱尔兰移居北部）。

It is true that immigration remains the subject of furious political debate. But that is probably because the people who really dislike it are prepared to base their voting decisions on this issue alone. Britons as a whole have become more relaxed, especially since the Brexit vote. They seem unfussed by one remarkable recent development. The top political jobs in Britain, Scotland and London are all held by the children of immigrants, all of South Asian descent. The first ministers of Northern Ireland and Wales were born abroad (although Michelle O’Neill only moved north from Ireland).

英国不能使每一个移民及其子女都成为受过良好教育、有生产力的社会成员。它面临着来自外部的偏见和激进的伊斯兰主义问题，尽管这个问题往往是本土滋生的。寻求庇护者的适应能力不及其他人，可能是因为政府将他们塞进酒店并阻止他们在等待审理期间工作。此外，政府在官僚作风上表现不佳。内政部臭名昭著地无能。它实际上通过提高入籍费用（实际成本自2000年以来增加了六倍）而拖慢了融合进程。

Britain cannot turn every migrant and every migrant’s child into well-educated, productive members of society. It struggles with imported prejudices and aggressive Islamism, although that problem is sadly often home-grown. Asylum-seekers do not adjust as well as others, possibly because the government crams them into hotels and prevents them from working while it sluggishly gets round to hearing their cases. Nor is the state good at bureaucracy. The Home Office is famously incompetent. It actually retards assimilation by charging so much for naturalisation—in real terms the cost has increased by six times since 2000.

此外，英国还有其他一两个无法被其他国家复制的优势。它离战区很远，因此获得的无邀请难民相对较少，而且碰巧使用的是许多人会说一点的语言。但英国成功的另外两个解释对其他国家来说更容易模仿。

Moreover, Britain has a couple of advantages that other countries cannot replicate. It is a long way from a war zone, so it gets relatively few uninvited refugees, and it happens to use a language that lots of people speak a little. But two other explanations for its success are easier for others to copy.

首先是英国灵活的劳动力市场。与欧洲其他地方相比，雇用和解雇过程更为简单，即使是受雇于正规合同下的人员。这有助于移民找到经济立足点，使其他事情变得更容易。排外的资格主义较弱。关于英国的一个不同寻常之处是，拥有外国学历的移民与拥有本国学历的人员几乎有着相同的就业率。在大多数欧洲国家中，这种差距很大；希腊的差距更是高达25个百分点。

The first is Britain’s flexible labour market. Compared with the rest of Europe, hiring and firing is straightforward, even for people who are employed under regular contracts. That helps immigrants find an economic foothold, which makes everything else easier. Xenophobic credentialism is weaker. One unusual thing about Britain is that immigrants with foreign qualifications have almost exactly the same employment rate as those with domestic qualifications. In most European countries the gap is large; in Greece it is an amazing 25 percentage points.

英国的另一个优势是其人民的态度。英国人心胸开阔。仅有5%的人告诉世界价值观调查，他们反对与移民住在一起（移民的子女在学校被欺负的比例低于本地人子女）。英国人将歧视与高期望相结合。与其他欧洲人相比，他们更希望移民学习语言，获得资格，接受文化并成为公民。可能有帮助的是英国从未拥有过客工。但其他地方的政治家最好不要预测这些接受了的新移民有一天会回家，正如德国总理安格拉·默克尔在2016年对难民所说的那样。

The country’s other advantage is the attitude of its people. Britons are open-minded. Just 5% told the World Values Survey that they would object to living next to an immigrant (and migrants’ children report being bullied at school less often than natives’ children). Britons combine an intolerance for discrimination with high expectations. Compared with other Europeans, they are keen for migrants to learn the language, obtain qualifications, adopt the culture and become citizens. It probably helps that Britain never had guest workers. But politicians elsewhere would be wise not to predict that newcomers it has accepted will one day go home, as Angela Merkel, then Germany’s chancellor, said of refugees in 2016.

最近英国并不是一个显而易见的模仿对象。它对欧洲其他国家的主要贡献是展示了退出欧盟的成本。但在融合方面，英国是需要超越的地方。■

Britain has not been an obvious country to copy recently. Its major service to the rest of Europe has been to show the costs of leaving the eu. But on integration it is the place to beat.■

为何日本经济仍是对他国的警示 (Why Japan’s economy remains a warning to others)
=============================================================

低实际利率、低增长和高债务不会消失 (Low real rates, low growth and high debts are not going away)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

![日本银行行长上田一夫在2024年3月19日举行的为期两天的货币政策会议后举行的新闻发布会上发言](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_LDP501.jpg)

本世纪大部分时间里，世界经济一直看起来像是走向了**日本式**经济，低增长、低于目标通胀率和极低的利率。如今问题是日本将会变得多像其他国家。3月19日，随着通胀似乎终于开始扎根，**日本银行**自2007年以来首次[提高了利率](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/03/19/japan-ends-the-worlds-greatest-monetary-policy-experiment)。隔夜贷款利率目标，此前介于负0.1%和0%之间，将提高百分之一。中央银行还取消了其限制长期债券收益率在1%的**期限利率控制**政策。**日本**多年来一直保持超宽松的货币政策，现在开始追随自从普遍通胀出现后其他经济体的做法。

For most of this century it has looked as if the world’s economy was turning Japanese, with low growth, below-target inflation and rock-bottom interest rates. Today the question is how much Japan will come to look like the rest of the world. On March 19th the Bank of Japan [raised interest rates](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/03/19/japan-ends-the-worlds-greatest-monetary-policy-experiment) for the first time since 2007, after inflation seemed at last to have become entrenched. The interest-rate target for overnight loans, previously between minus 0.1% and 0%, will rise by a tenth of a percentage point. The central bank also scrapped its policy of yield-curve control, which capped long-term bond yields at 1%. Having kept monetary policy ultra-loose for years, Japan has now begun to follow the course set by other economies since widespread inflation took hold.

这是一个显著的时刻。2022年之前，年通胀率只有在过去120个月中的12个月内超过了2%；如今，已连续22个月超过这一水平。**日本**最大的企业最近同意将工资提高5.3%，这一水平在全球通胀爆发前是不可想象的。人们有一种变革来临的感觉。股市一直繁荣昌盛——日经225指数最近超过了1989年12月创下的历史记录，投资者对经济持乐观态度。

It is a remarkable moment. Before 2022 annual inflation had been above 2% for only 12 of the previous 120 months; today it has been above that level for 22 consecutive months. Japan’s biggest firms recently agreed to increase wages by 5.3%, a level that would have been unthinkable before the global inflation breakout. There is a sense that change is here to stay. Stocks have been booming—the Nikkei 225 recently passed the record it set in December 1989—and investors are optimistic about the economy.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_LDC006.png)

然而，认为**日本**正在摆脱**日本化**是错误的。比通胀、标头利率和股市增长等名义属性更重要的是一个经济体的实际结构特征。如果你看基本面，甚至是利率上升也不完全是表面所见。**日本银行**认为已经可以实现的2%通胀目标，比过去10年年均通胀率高出1.4个百分点。这1.4个百分点的预计通胀上升远远超过0.1个百分点的利率上升，因此从实质上看，利率实际上是下降而非上升。此外，**日本银行**在其3月19日的声明中明确表示，预期将维持“宽松”的金融条件，并会继续购买一些债券。

Yet it would be wrong to conclude that Japan is de-Japanifying. More important than an economy’s nominal attributes such as inflation, headline interest rates and stockmarket growth are its real, structural features. If you look at the fundamentals, even the rise in interest rates is not quite what it seems. The 2% inflation target which the Bank of Japan believes is now in sight is 1.4 percentage points higher than the average inflation rate over the ten years to the end of 2021. This 1.4-point rise in projected inflation towers over the 0.1-point rise in interest rates, which in real terms have therefore fallen, not risen. Moreover, the bank made clear in its statement on March 19th that it expected to maintain “accommodative” financial conditions and would keep buying some bonds.

极低的实际利率反映了**日本**拥有大量储蓄，部分原因是其老龄人口较多——30%的人口年龄在65岁以上。企业很难将这些储蓄投入到创造性的用途中，因为一个人口逐渐减少的经济体对资本投资的需求减少。**日本**的人口结构和不愿意承认移民也限制了其增长。国际货币基金组织预计未来四年**日本**的gdp每年只会增长0.5%，而美国为2%。考虑到缺乏劳动力，这是可以接受的——单位劳动力产出的增长是健康的。但这并不是一场复苏。

Rock-bottom real rates reflect the fact that Japan has abundant savings, partly because its population is so old—30% are over 65. Firms struggle to put these to productive use, because an economy with a shrinking population has less appetite for capital investment. Japan’s demography and reluctance to admit immigrants also constrain its growth. The IMF expects gdp to rise by only 0.5% annually over the next four years, compared with 2% in America. That is respectable given the lack of workers—growth in output per worker has been healthy. But it is hardly a resurgence.

最后一个因素是**日本**持续的公共负债。债务占gdp的比例按总额计算为255%，按净额计算为159%；这两项指标均是富裕国家中最高的。即使在利率较低的情况下，近9%的政府预算被用于支付债务利息。**日本**无法承受类似于美国的紧缩货币政策，美国的利率已达到5.25-5.5%。

A final factor is Japan’s enduring public indebtedness. The debt-to-GDP ratio is 255% in gross terms, or 159% after netting off the government’s financial assets; both measures are the highest in the rich world. Even with low interest rates, nearly 9% of the government budget is spent on debt interest. Japan could not withstand a monetary tightening anything like as severe as the one in America, where rates have reached 5.25-5.5%.

早在**日本**达到这样的利率水平之前，政府将不得不削减财政赤字，这一赤字在2023年占gdp的5.6%。经济将因财政紧缩而降温，而非利率上升。在货币政策和增长方面，**日本**将不再是例外只有一种途径：如果世界其他地方开始变得像它一样。 ■

Long before they got to such levels in Japan, the government would have to reduce its deficit, which was 5.6% of GDP in 2023. The economy would cool from fiscal belt-tightening, not higher rates. With monetary policy, as with growth, there remains only one path by which Japan will cease to be exceptional: if the rest of the world comes to resemble it. ■

中国的低生育困境 (China’s low-fertility trap)
==================================

一孩政策或已废除，但其有害影响仍挥之不去。 (The one-child policy may be gone, but its harmful effects linger)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Illustration of a cot mobile hanging above a cot, featuring a crescent moon, clouds, and stars arranged to resemble the flag of China.](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_CND000.jpg)

![插图显示了一个悬挂在婴儿床上方的婴儿床移动挂饰，上面有一个新月、云朵和星星排列成中国国旗的样子。]

A SMALL NUMBER should haunt the sleep of China’s leaders: 1.1. That is the number of children that, given prevailing trends, each Chinese woman is expected to have on average during her child-bearing years. China’s total fertility rate (TFR), to use the demographers’ term, has fallen far below the 2.1 children needed for a stable population. Sure enough, in 2023 China’s population declined for the second year in a row.

**一个小数字应该萦绕在中国领导人的梦魇中：1.1**。这是每位中国妇女在生育年龄内预计平均会生育的子女数量。中国的总生育率（TFR），用人口统计学家的术语来说，已经远低于维持人口稳定所需的2.1个子女。果然，在2023年，中国的人口连续第二年下降。

Communist Party bosses may cling to a (thin) comfort. This disaster has many causes, only one of which is their one-child policy, the harsh system that between 1980 and 2016 limited most urban families to a single child, and many rural folk to two. Most of China’s fertility decline happened in the 1970s, as a result of such forces as urbanisation and women’s education (Mao-era calls for large families also stopped). Similar forces saw birth rates plunge across East Asia. Japan’s TFR has fallen below 1.3 and in South Korea, catastrophically, it is below 0.8. The rapid ageing of China’s population also follows patterns seen region-wide.

共产党领导人或许可以抓住一点（微弱的）慰藉。这场灾难有许多原因，而独生子女政策只是其中之一，这项严厉制度在1980年至2016年间限制了大多数城市家庭只能生育一个子女，而很多农村家庭只能生育两个子女。中国的生育下降大部分发生在上世纪70年代，受城市化和妇女教育等因素的影响（毛时代提倡大家庭的政策也停止了）。类似的力量导致了东亚各国的出生率急剧下降。日本的TFR已降至1.3以下，在韩国更是灾难性地低至0.8以下。中国人口的迅速老龄化也遵循了整个地区的模式。

Even so, pangs of remorse should trouble party chiefs’ dreams. The one-child policy is not the sole reason for this crisis, but its legacy will make it exceptionally hard for China to escape demographic doom. China’s population structure has been left permanently skewed. Brutal, often corrupt officials enforced rules with propaganda, fines and tens of millions of abortions and sterilisations, many of them involuntary. There are about 150m one-child families today. Worse, many parents who wanted sons chose to abort girls, leaving China with 30m fewer women than men.

尽管如此，懊悔之情应该扰乱党主管人员的梦境。独生子女政策不是这场危机的唯一原因，但其遗产将使中国异常难以摆脱人口结构危机。中国的人口结构永久性地被扭曲了。残酷、常常腐败的官员通过宣传、罚款和数千万次的强制堕胎和结扎来强制执行规定，其中很多是非自愿的。如今大约有1.5亿的独生子女家庭。更糟糕的是，许多想要儿子的父母选择堕胎女婴，导致中国比男性少约3000万女性。

The policy was both cruel and a blunder. Family-planning officials assumed that birth rates would spring back once controls were abolished. Alas, they re-educated parents too well. One child became the norm, certainly in cities. Consider another figure that should haunt leaders: 1.7. That is the number of children that, on average, Chinese women of child-bearing age call ideal. China’s ideal is one of the world’s lowest, far below the number given in Japan or South Korea. Chinese women born after 1995 want the fewest of all: 48.3% of them told the Chinese General Social Survey of 2021 that they desire one or no children. There is growing evidence that such attitudes are powerfully shaped by how people, and those around them, experienced the one-child policy.

这项政策既残酷又愚蠢。计划生育官员假定一旦废除了控制措施，生育率就会弹回。不幸的是，他们训练了父母们得太好了。一胎成为了规范，尤其是在城市里。考虑另一个应该困扰领导者的数字：**1.7**。这是中国育龄妇女平均认为理想的子女数量。中国的理想生育率是全球最低之一，远低于日本或韩国的生育率。1995年之后出生的中国女性希望子女最少，其中**48.3%**的女性在2021年的中国社会普查中表示，她们希望只生育一名子女或根本不生。越来越多的证据表明，这种态度受到人们及其周围人经历过独生子女政策的强大影响。

When asked why they want small families, Chinese parents usually cite the costs of child-rearing. In fact, there is no neat link between fertility rates and average incomes. Birth rates are very low in China’s richest city, Shanghai, but also in its post-industrial north-east. Those very different places do have something in common. Shanghai enforced childbirth rules sternly. So did state-owned firms that employed millions in the north-east, notes Yu Jia of the Centre for Social Research at Peking University.

当被问及为什么希望家庭规模小，中国父母通常会提到抚养子女的成本。实际上，生育率与平均收入之间并没有明显的联系。在中国最富裕的城市上海，出生率非常低，而在后工业化的东北地区也是如此。这两个截然不同的地方有一个共同点。北京大学社会研究中心的于佳指出，上海严格执行了生育规定。东北地区数百万职工被雇佣的国有企业也是如此。

Another revealing variation involves the roughly one in 11 Chinese who are from ethnic minorities. The policy was enforced (a bit) less strictly for minorities, allowing larger families to remain the norm in isolated places like Tibet, but also in diverse rural regions home to the Bai, Miao, Yi, Zhuang and other peoples. Distinctive effects may be seen to this day. Even after controlling for education and degrees of social contact with China’s dominant Han majority, many ethnic groups stand out for wanting larger families. One consistent factor, says Ms Yu, is that minority households had “different one-child rules applied to them”.

另一个有意义的变化涉及约11分之1的中国少数民族。对于少数民族，政策（略微）执行得不那么严格，使得像西藏这样的偏远地区和拥有白族、苗族、彝族、壮族等民族的多样农村地区依然保留着较大家庭的传统。这些独特的影响可能至今仍然可见。即使在控制了教育水平和与中国主体民族的社会接触程度后，许多少数民族群体因希望拥有较大家庭而显著突出。于女士表示，一个一致的因素是，少数民族家庭被“施加了不同的单独子女政策”。

Intrigued, Chaguan headed to Guizhou, a province in China’s south-west with many minorities and the highest birth rates of any region outside Tibet. Locals offered varied explanations for high fertility rates and vivid memories of family-planning rules. Heading into the mountainous heartland of the Miao people, a first stop was the township of Zhou Xi. Locals thronged an open-air fair marking a Miao festival, Lusheng. Stalls sold tangerines, sugar cane and roast dog. Mr Wang, a father in his 30s, watched two sons playing on a bouncy castle. One of three siblings himself, he recalled how his own mother hid from officials enforcing her village’s two-child limit. Rule-breakers braved fines and the confiscation of cows, chickens or pigs to have larger families. “We Miao are more hospitable in every way, we prefer to have lots of relatives and friends,” Mr Wang explained.

对此感到好奇，笔者走到了贵州省，这里是中国西南部的一个拥有众多少数民族并且生育率最高的地区之一，除了西藏以外。当地人对高生育率提出了各种解释，以及对计划生育规则的生动记忆。前往苗族山区核心地带的州西镇，首站是参加苗族节日“芦笙”庆祝活动的当地人。摊位上售卖柑橘、甘蔗和烤狗肉。三十多岁的王先生看着两个儿子在充气城堡上玩耍。他自己也有三个兄弟姐妹，他回忆起他的母亲是如何躲避当地官员实行两个孩子限制的。违反规定者冒着罚款和没收牛、鸡或猪的风险来生育更多子女。“我们苗族在各方面更好客，我们更愿意有很多亲戚和朋友，”王先生解释说。

Next, a winding road led to Puzi, a wood-smoke-scented mountain hamlet. Many working-age villagers are Miao, but toil in faraway Han Chinese towns. Some have picked up big-city views. Mr Mu has worked in a factory in Dongguan, a southern coastal city, for almost 12 years. He returned to Puzi for the recent Spring Festival and stayed on to attend a funeral. He has two sons and cited Miao beliefs that one child is not enough. But his neighbours in Dongguan with a lone child enjoy an “easier” life, he ventured. Faced with the prospect of helping his sons buy cars and homes so that they can marry, he sighed: “I’m under a lot of pressure.”

接着，一条蜿蜒的小路通往了一个被木烟味环绕的山村普资。许多劳动年龄的村民是苗族，但在遥远的汉族城镇工作。一些人开始接受大城市的观念。木先生在东莞工厂里工作了将近12年。他在最近的春节回家并留下参加葬礼。他有两个儿子，并提到苗族认为一个孩子不够的信仰。但是在东莞的邻居们只有一个孩子，他们过着“更轻松”的生活，木先生推测。面对帮助儿子买车、买房以及结婚的压力，他叹息道：“我承受着重压。”

The final stop was Guiyang, the sleepy provincial capital where Han Chinese and minorities live side by side. In a park outside a children’s hospital, your columnist met a Han couple in their late 30s from Hunan province, Mr Luo and Ms Yang. They had a first child 13 years ago, while working in the wealthy eastern province of Jiangsu, and feared more would be “too tiring”. If they had stayed in Jiangsu, they would still have one, they said. But after moving to Guiyang to open a shop, Miao neighbours convinced them that solo children are “lonely”. They ended up with three, laughed Ms Yang, as a pair of small children tugged at her sleeves.

最后一站是贵阳，这个宁静的省会城市，汉族和少数民族共同生活在这里。在一家儿童医院外的公园里，笔者见到了一对来自湖南省的汉族夫妇，罗先生和杨女士，他们已经三十多岁。他们在江苏富裕省份工作时有了第一个孩子，**13**年前，担心再要一个孩子会“太累人了”。他们说，如果他们留在江苏，他们可能还只有一个孩子。但搬到贵阳开了一家店后，苗族邻居们说服他们，独生子女“孤独”。最终他们有了三个孩子，杨女士笑着说，两个小孩在扯着她的袖子。

Even here, 20-something locals are converging with national norms, marrying later and wanting just one or two children, reported Ms Yang, adding: “Probably we are the generation who will have the most children.” Words to haunt China’s leaders. ■

即便在这里，二十多岁的当地人也逐渐与全国趋势保持一致，结婚更晚，希望只有一个或两个孩子，杨女士报道说：“我们可能是将生孩子的人数最多的一代。” 这番话应该让中国领导者深思。■

作为中国加强对[香港](https://www.economist.com/china/2024/01/25/hong-kong-is-becoming-less-of-an-international-city)控制的象征，被称为[第23条](https://www.economist.com/china/2024/01/31/hong-kong-gets-a-second-draconian-security-law)的国家安全法律可谓独步全球。这项措施授予了当局更多镇压异议的权力，并于3月19日被香港立法会（如图）一致通过。这并不奇怪。自2021年以来，该机构的成员必须宣誓效忠北京的中央政府。反对派政治人士被取消资格、投入监狱或被迫逃往国外。然而，这项少数香港人认为不必要却被中央政府要求的法案迅速通过，加强了香港失去自治权的现状。

AS A SYMBOL of China’s tightening grip on [Hong Kong](https://www.economist.com/china/2024/01/25/hong-kong-is-becoming-less-of-an-international-city), the national-security law known as [Article 23](https://www.economist.com/china/2024/01/31/hong-kong-gets-a-second-draconian-security-law) takes some beating. The measure, which grants the authorities more powers to clamp down on dissent, was passed unanimously by the city’s legislative council, or Legco (pictured), on March 19th. That is hardly surprising. Since 2021 members of the body have had to swear allegiance to the central government in Beijing. Opposition politicians have been disqualified, thrown in jail or forced to flee abroad. Still, the swift passage of a bill that few Hong Kongers thought was needed, but the central government demanded, reinforces the city’s loss of autonomy.

该法律涵盖了叛国、叛乱和间谍等罪行。它与中央政府于2020年强加于香港的一项安全法重叠，此前该市在大规模争取民主的示威活动后一年被动荡。但最新措施有新的元素应引起自由派的担忧。例如，任何被指控触犯法律的人可能被剥夺律师权并在法庭批准下将拘留期延长14天（在此之前只允许48小时）。该法律还使更多案件有资格由由香港行政长官李家超挑选的国家安全法官审理，而不是由陪审团。

The law covers offences such as treason, insurrection and espionage. It overlaps with a security law [imposed on Hong Kong](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/07/02/chinas-draconian-security-law-for-hong-kong-buries-one-country-two-systems) by the central government in 2020, a year after the city was rocked by big pro-democracy gatherings. But the latest measure has new elements that ought to worry liberal types. For example, anyone accused of breaking the law can be denied access to a solicitor and have their detention extended by 14 days (on top of the 48 hours previously allowed) with court approval. The law also makes more cases eligible to be heard by national-security judges—who are picked by John Lee, Hong Kong’s chief executive—rather than by a jury.

同样令人担忧的是新法律关注“外部干预”香港事务。李家超认为神秘的外国力量在2019年的示威活动背后，而且今天仍在制造麻烦（中央政府也持有的一种阴谋论观点）。他警告称“狼”正在试图通过在香港倡导自由和民主来破坏中国。亲政府的媒体报道称，致力于人权的国际NGO组织——大赦国际，以及专注于环保的绿色和平可能被列为国家安全威胁。

Just as concerning is the new law’s focus on “external interference” in Hong Kong’s affairs. Mr Lee thinks that shadowy foreign forces were behind the demonstrations in 2019 and are still stirring up trouble today (a conspiratorial view shared by the central government). He has warned of “wolves” trying to undermine China by advocating freedom and democracy in Hong Kong. Government-friendly media have reported that Amnesty International, which campaigns for human rights, and Greenpeace, which focuses on the environment, could be among the international NGOs designated as national-security threats.

新法律还可能让新闻媒体的工作变得更加困难。该法保护符合公众利益的新闻报道，但政府将做出裁决。一封由多家外国媒体（包括**经济学人**）签署的信表达了对正常新闻活动可能被犯罪化的担忧，如对决策进行分析和批评、调查政府不端行为。

The press itself may also find its job harder. The law protects news reports that are in the public interest, but the government will be the arbiter of that. A letter signed by several foreign outlets (including *The Economist*) expressed concern that normal journalistic activity, such as analysis and criticism of decision-making and investigating government malpractice, could be criminalised.

法律措辞含糊，这可能是故意而为。它给了当局很大的自由裁量权。政府无疑希望香港人和外国人在面临模糊的红线时离其远点。但政府还不得不驳斥几则谣言，比如西方社交媒体平台可能会被禁止的传言。还有传言称，拥有包含被视为煽动性的文章的旧报纸的人可能会被起诉。政府表示这是“完全错误的”，违法行为只会发生在所有者没有“合理理由”的情况下。

The wording of the law is vague, probably by design. It gives the authorities lots of room for manoeuvre. And the government no doubt hopes that Hong Kongers and foreigners, facing fuzzy red lines, will pull up well short of them. But officials have also had to bat down several rumours, such as that Western social-media platforms might be banned. There was also buzz that people might be prosecuted for possessing old newspapers that contained articles deemed seditious. This is “completely wrong”, said the government—the offence would apply only if the owner did not have a “reasonable excuse”.

1997年英国将香港交还给中国时，它获得了一部名为《基本法》的小宪法，并承诺在“一国两制”的模式下享有“高度自治”。居民被授予了大陆中国人所被剥夺的自由和公民权利。然而，该文件的第23条笼罩着这座城市。这要求香港通过全国安全立法，许多人担心这将改变其性质。当政府试图在2003年推动这样一项措施时，公众做出了大规模抗议，城市的领导人被迫退让。

When Hong Kong was handed back to China by the British in 1997 it was given a mini-constitution, called the Basic Law, and promised “a high degree of autonomy” under the “one country, two systems” model. Residents were granted freedoms and civil liberties denied to Chinese on the mainland. Yet Article 23 of the document loomed over the city. It required Hong Kong to pass national-security legislation that many people feared would alter its character. When the government tried to push through such a measure in 2003, the public responded with large protests and the city’s leaders backed down.

这一次措施顺利通过的速度展示了香港发生了多么大的变化。近年来，言论、新闻媒体、图书和文化的控制变得更加严格，听从中央政府的命令。旧的安全法律已经阻止了大多数有政治诉求的人试图挑战当局。新法加剧了这种恐惧氛围。在未来几天内不太可能发生重大抗议活动。

The ease with which the measure passed this time round shows just how much has changed in Hong Kong. In recent years, controls on speech, news media, books and culture have grown more stifling, at the behest of the central government. The older security law had already deterred most people with political grievances from attempting to challenge the authorities. The new one adds to this atmosphere of fear. No big protests are expected in the coming days.

然而，政府迅速通过第23条的举措引起了轩然大波。该法案于1月30日公布。随后进行了一次异常简短的公开咨询，截止日期为2月28日。然后该法案被快速通过立法会。有人认为这样做的目的是为了避免引起外国观察员的指责。即使如此，该策略也失败了。联合国人权事务高级专员建议此举与国际法不相容。欧盟警告可能威胁香港作为全球商业中心的地位。英国称这将“损害城市居民的权利和自由”。

But the speed with which the government moved to pass Article 23 has raised eyebrows. It was unveiled on January 30th. There followed an unusually brief public consultation, which closed on February 28th. The bill was then rushed through Legco. Some believe the aim was to avoid criticism by catching foreign observers off guard. If so, the gambit failed. The UN’s high commissioner for human rights suggested the measure was incompatible with international law. The EU warned that it might threaten Hong Kong’s status as a global commercial hub. Britain said it would “damage the rights and freedoms” of city residents.

香港官员预计会受到后果。据说在委员会阶段审议该法案的议员已开始称自己为“烈士”，因为他们预计将受到西方政府的制裁。但李永进一直在取悦另一方面的听众。他将这一时刻称为“历史性”，并补充说立法会“没有让中央政府失望”。行政长官及其同事认为原先的安全法有助于为这座城市带来和平与繁荣，并认为新法律也将产生类似的积极影响。如果香港人民不同意，他们将不得不悄悄表示。■

Hong Kong officials are expecting repercussions. The lawmakers who scrutinised the bill at the committee stage are said to have begun referring to themselves as “martyrs” because they expect to be hit with sanctions by Western governments. But Mr Lee always aimed to please a different audience. He called the moment “historic”, adding that Legco “did not let the central government down”. The chief executive and his colleagues credit the original security law with helping to bring peace and prosperity to the city, and think the new law will have a similarly positive impact. If the people of Hong Kong disagree, they will have to say so quietly. ■



<hr><span style="color: red;"><b>中国 | 轰鸣爆炸！太吵闹，难以消除</b></span> (China | Bang and blast! It’s too noisy to muffle)

即使中国自己的官方媒体有时也反感国家控制 (Even China’s own state media sometimes resent state control)
===============================================================================

对一起致命爆炸的审查在当地记者中引起骚动 (Censorship of a deadly explosion causes ructions among local journalists)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![中国警察准备将记者推开，远离中国北部三河市爆炸现场](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_CNP002.jpg)

在中国警察懒散地挡住电视新闻摄像机镜头或强行把记者赶离重大事件现场的景象并不罕见。这种情况经常发生在外国记者身上。但本月，许多人都感到震惊，因为中国央视记者遇到了同样的对待。甚至在一场直播中，主持人也无法掩饰自己在直播中同事在致命爆炸现场被推开时的惊讶之情。

There is nothing unusual about the sight of Chinese policemen oafishly blocking the lens of a television-news camera, or bundling reporters away from the scene of a big event. It happens to foreign journalists all the time. But many were stunned this month when reporters from China Central Television (CCTV), the country’s leading state-run broadcaster, got the same treatment. Even the anchor of a live telecast could not hide her on-air surprise when colleagues reporting from the site of a deadly explosion were shoved away.

这起爆炸事件发生在3月13日早高峰时段，地点是中国首都北京城界外几公里的通勤小镇燕郊，7人丧生，27人受伤。此事凸显了有关政权控制新闻的长期存在的问题。

The blast occurred at rush hour on the morning of March 13th in Yanjiao, a commuter town just a few kilometres beyond the boundary of Beijing, China’s capital. Seven people were killed and 27 injured. The incident highlighted long-simmering questions about the regime’s control of news.

在另一起事件中，中国中央广播电视总台的子公司中国媒体集团的一名记者在网上发布了一个视频，展示了她的团队在现场同样遭到警察粗暴对待的情况。随后，通常在有争议事件发生时都会快速出现的社交媒体上迅速出现尖锐的评论。一名用户写道，那位强大的党控制媒体“也尝到了社会主义铁腕的滋味”。另一位写道，央视记者现在享受与外国媒体相同的待遇。

In another incident a reporter for China Media Group, CCTV’s parent company, posted a video online of her team’s similarly rough handling by police at the scene. Pointed commentary came quickly, as it often does around controversial events, on social media. The mighty party-controlled media, wrote one user, “also gets a taste of the iron fist of socialism”. Now, wrote another, CCTV journalists are enjoying the same treatment as foreign media.

更为特殊的是，中国新闻工作者协会在爆炸当晚发表了一份强烈声明，通常它们是一群温顺的、由党控制的人。该组织表示，“合法采访是记者的权利”。当局不应当“粗暴地阻碍记者正常进行工作，以控制舆论”。协会表示，客观报道有助于“缓解公众焦虑”并“保护人民知情权”。

More unusual was a sharp statement on the night of the explosion by the All-China Journalists’ Association, normally a docile party-controlled lot. “Legitimate news-gathering is a journalist’s right,” said the group. The authorities must not “crudely obstruct journalists from conducting their work in a normal manner in order to control public sentiment”. Objective reports, the association said, can help “alleviate public anxiety” and “protect the people’s right to know”.

自2012年上台以来，中国国家领导人习近平明确表示，向公众提供客观信息并不是中国媒体的首要任务。相反，它是“维护党的权威”并“在思想、政治和行动上与党的领导密切对齐”。

Since taking power in 2012 the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, has made clear that informing the public with objective information is not the Chinese media’s priority. Rather it is to “safeguard the party’s authority” and “closely align themselves with the party leadership in thought, politics and action”.

央视工作人员表示，近年来对他们工作的国家控制加强了。这种情况很少像在燕郊那样明显。但记者们一直以来都必须事先获得报道地点的批准，并严格受到审查员的监督，选择报道主题和决定采访对象。

CCTV staffers say state control over their work has tightened in recent years. It is rarely as visible as it was in Yanjiao. But reporters have long had to get advance approval before reporting at any site and are strictly supervised by censors in choosing topics and deciding whom to interview.

当地官员在一天后对他们在燕郊对待记者的道歉。爆炸一周后，现场依然布满紧急救援车辆，并被警察警戒线封锁。当地居民仍然抱怨对灾害真正原因一无所知。警方礼貌但非常坚定地坚持记者不得拍照。 ■

Local officials apologised a day later for their treatment of the journalists in Yanjiao. A week after the explosion, the site remained full of emergency vehicles and roped off behind police cordons. Local residents still grumbled about remaining in the dark over the disaster’s true cause. In polite but very firm fashion, police insisted that your correspondent must not take photographs.■

THERE SEEMS to be no end to official anxiety over social media in America. The idea that TikTok, a popular Chinese app, might be used as a tool of Communist Party propaganda has terrified politicians. On March 13th the House of Representatives passed a bill that would force the platform’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the app or else face a ban in America. Five days later the Supreme Court heard a case over the Biden administration’s requests that social-media companies remove posts containing misinformation. Both stories speak to the power of these firms, which play an enormous role in disseminating news and guiding opinions.

**对**社交媒体在美国引发的官方不安似乎没有尽头。关于中国热门应用抖音可能被用作共产党宣传工具的想法让政客们感到恐慌。3月13日，众议院通过了一项法案，要求该平台的中国所有者字节跳动出售该应用，否则将在美国面临禁令。五天后，最高法院审理了有关拜登政府请求社交媒体公司删除包含虚假信息的帖子的案件。这两则新闻都反映了这些公司的强大影响力，在传播新闻和引导舆论方面发挥着巨大作用。

That is no less true of social media in China. The party long ago banned American-owned sites such as Facebook, X and YouTube. But China’s own versions have filled the gap. Like their American counterparts, they have evolved into broad media platforms. A survey in 2022 found that 46% of Chinese get their news from short-video apps such as Douyin, the domestic form of TikTok which has about 740m active monthly users (China’s population is 1.4bn). Another third or so catch up while perusing platforms like Weibo, an X-like site owned by a company called Sina. Many also look to WeChat, a messaging app from Tencent which has 1.3bn users.

在中国，社交媒体的情况也并非不同。党很早就禁止了像Facebook、X和YouTube等美国所有的网站。但中国自己的版本则填补了这一空白。和美国同行一样，它们演变成为广泛的媒体平台。一项调查显示，2022年有46%的中国人通过短视频应用获取新闻，如国内版的抖音——每月拥有约7.4亿活跃用户（中国人口为14亿）。另有约三分之一在浏览微博等平台时了解新闻，微博是新浪公司旗下一个类似X的网站。许多人还会通过腾讯旗下的消息应用微信获取信息，其用户达13亿。

Given the party’s [tight control of information](https://www.economist.com/china/2024/03/21/even-chinas-own-state-media-sometimes-resent-state-control) and deep suspicion of private enterprise, this looks from the outside like a remarkable state of affairs. The party, though, has harnessed social media to deliver its message. The platforms are scrubbed of subversive content. Still, officials in Beijing worry about them as much as politicians in Washington do.

考虑到党对信息的**紧密**控制和对私营企业的深切疑虑，这看起来从外部来看是一个引人注目的局面。然而，党已经利用社交媒体传递其信息。这些平台被清理出**颠覆**性内容。尽管如此，北京官员们对此的担忧与华盛顿政治家们的担忧一样多。

The party certainly did not plan for social media to play such a big role in informing the public. For much of their life, these firms were viewed by the government primarily as drivers of economic growth. Their founders were held up as entrepreneurial heroes. And, for the most part, they knew not to cross the party. In 2018 the founder of ByteDance, Zhang Yiming, issued a cringeworthy public apology after one of his social-media platforms was criticised by regulators for hosting indecent content. “I have been filled with remorse and guilt, entirely unable to sleep,” he said, admitting that his product was “incommensurate with socialist core values”.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_CNC893.png)

党肯定没有计划让社交媒体在向公众提供信息方面扮演如此重要的角色。在很大一段时间里，政府将这些公司视为经济增长的推动者。他们的创始人被奉为企业英雄。而且，在大多数情况下，他们知道不得违背党的意志。2018年，字节跳动的创始人张一鸣在他的一个社交媒体平台因被监管机构批评出现不雅内容而发表了一篇令人难堪的公开道歉。他说：“我充满懊悔和愧疚，整夜难以入眠”，承认他的产品与“社会主义核心价值观”不符。

But as their audiences and influence grew (see chart), social-media firms, along with the rest of the tech industry, came under more scrutiny. In 2020 regulators clamped down, deeming tech companies to have strayed too far from the values cited by Mr Zhang. The regulatory regime that emerged embeds the party even more deeply in the industry. ByteDance, Tencent and Sina already had internal party committees that were consulted over big decisions. In recent years state investors have also taken small stakes in key subsidiaries of the firms. These “golden shares” let the government appoint board members, among other things.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_CNC893.png)

Even so, party officials exhibit anxiety similar to—if not exactly the same as—the twitchiness on display in America. While the Biden administration goes after misinformation, China’s ruling party desperately tries to root out anything that contradicts its line. The methods, of course, differ. China’s government spends $6.6bn a year censoring online content, estimates the Jamestown Foundation, a think-tank in America. In one two-month period last year the authorities claim to have deleted 1.4m social-media posts and 67,000 accounts (ironically, they branded many of the posts “misinformation”). More recently officials launched an investigation into short-video platforms that were spreading “pessimism” among young people, many of whom are struggling to find jobs.

但随着他们的受众和影响力的增长（见图表），社交媒体公司以及科技行业的其他部分受到了更多的审查。2020年，监管机构开始加强打击，认为科技公司偏离了张先生提到的价值观。出台的监管体制使党更深地渗入了这个行业。字节跳动、腾讯和新浪已经设立了内部党委，这些党委在重大决策时会进行咨询。近年来，国家投资者还在这些公司的重要子公司中持有小股份。这些“黄金股”让政府能任命董事会成员等。

Unwelcome content still gets through, however. In 2022, for example, a short video showing the cruelties of a covid-19 lockdown in Shanghai was shared by millions of Chinese netizens. They moved faster than censors could keep up, using tricks such as inverting the video or embedding it in cartoon clips in order to avoid detection.

尽管如此，与美国政府类似，党官员表现出类似于—如果不是完全相同于—美国政府所表现的**紧张**。拜登政府打击**虚假信息**，中国执政党则极力消除任何与其立场相矛盾的东西。当然，方法不尽相同。美国智库詹姆斯敦基金会估计，中国政府每年在审查在线内容上花费66亿美元。去年的一个两个月时间里，有关部门声称删除了140万条社交媒体帖子和6.7万个账户（讽刺的是，他们将其中许多帖子贴上了“**虚假信息**” 的标签）。最近，官员们对那些在年轻人中散播“悲观主义”的短视频平台展开了调查，许多年轻人正在为找工作感到苦恼。

Perhaps a bigger concern is foreign interference via social media. Here, too, the anxiety resembles America’s. “All sides strive to spread and amplify their own propaganda, and denounce and suppress the other party’s propaganda, by manipulating social-media platforms,” wrote a researcher at China’s Academy of Military Science in 2022. The fears of Chinese officials were no doubt heightened when Reuters reported this month that in 2019 the CIA launched a clandestine campaign on Chinese social media aimed at turning public opinion against the government. (It is thought to have made little impact.)

然而，仍有不受欢迎的内容通过审核。例如，2022年，一个展示上海新冠封锁的残酷情况的短视频被数百万中国网民分享。他们运用了比审查更快的方式，比如将视频反转或者将其嵌入卡通片段中以避免被检测到。

Today the government is digging in deeper, examining the algorithms that decide what users see on social media. Since 2022 companies have been required to register their algorithms with regulators and explain their logic. Most of the time, the code brings to the fore content the party likes. The top spot on Weibo’s list of trending topics is usually news about what China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is doing. In 2020 researchers at Stanford University tracked which videos were trending on Douyin over a period of four months and found that 57% were created by government or party-affiliated organisations.

也许更大的担忧是通过社交媒体的外国干预。在这方面，担忧也类似于美国。“各方努力通过操纵社交媒体平台传播和放大自己的宣传，并谴责和打压对方的宣传** propagated propagandaby**，”中国军事科学院的一名研究员在2020年写道。路透社本月报道说，2019年中央情报局启动了一场针对中国社交媒体的秘密运动，旨在扭转公众对政府的舆论。 （据悉这些运动影响不大。）

But the algorithms work in mysterious ways. Sometimes even their creators cannot explain why they recommend one thing over another. The party does not like such uncertainty. In many ways it has co-opted social media for its own purposes. Yet it must long for the days when Chinese people could only get their news from state-run television and newspapers. ■

如今，政府正在深入研究社交媒体上决定用户看到内容的算法。自2022年以来，公司被要求向监管机构注册其算法并解释其逻辑。大多数情况下，这些代码会推荐党喜欢的内容。微博热门话题榜的榜首通常是关于中国领导人习近平正在做什么的新闻。2020年，斯坦福大学的研究人员在四个月的时间里追踪了抖音上热门视频，发现57%是由政府或党派机构创建的。

但算法的运作方式却很神秘。有时甚至它们的创建者都无法解释为什么推荐这个而不是那个。党不喜欢这样的不确定性。在许多方面，它利用社交媒体来实现自己的目的。然而，它一定怀念中国人只能从官方电视和报纸获取新闻的日子。■

在纽约皇后区一个商业区，对面是一个编发沙龙，旁边是一家麦当劳，两名保安标志着牙买加性健康诊所的入口。多年来，这里一直是该社区进行性病检测和艾滋病治疗的首选地点。来自公共卫生诊所局的华金·阿拉塞纳自豪地展示了其最新的成员：生殖健康区。新粉刷的白墙和淡绿色的门显然比诊所的其他部分看起来不那么机构化。

On a commercial stretch of Queens, New York, across from a hair-braiding salon and next to a McDonald’s, two security guards mark the entrance to the Jamaica Sexual Health Clinic. For years this has been the neighbourhood’s go-to place for STI testing and HIV treatment. Joaquin Aracena, from the Bureau of Public Health Clinics, proudly shows its newest addition: the [reproductive-health](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/16/some-progressives-are-arguing-for-a-religious-right-to-abortion) wing. With freshly painted white walls and pastel-green doors, it is distinctly less institutional-looking than the rest of the clinic.

他说：“一旦他们废除了《罗伊诉韦德案》，我就能得到这个空间。” 该诊所现在免费提供随时就诊的药物流产。显然，消息已经传播开来。去年，该诊所提供了略多于700次**流产**；在一月份是100次，今天早上两名护士执业医师已经让四名妇女带着非透明袋回家，里面装着她们终止怀孕所需的药片。

“Once they did [away with] *Roe v Wade* I was able to get this space,” he says. The clinic now offers walk-in medication abortions free to all. Word is clearly spreading. Last year it provided just over 700 [abortions;](https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/06/abortion-bans-in-america-are-corroding-some-doctors-souls) in January it was 100, and this morning the two nurse practitioners have already sent four women home with a non-transparent bag containing the pills they need to terminate their pregnancies.

这是2022年最高法院裁定推翻《罗伊》案意外的结果之一，这个裁决将流产问题交由各州处理并触发了禁令。纽约市卫生局长阿希温·瓦桑说，这让城市政府有了更多精力参与协调提供**流产**服务。这包括在亚利桑那州和德克萨斯州竖立广告牌，并在城市中的未被充分服务的区域开设诊所。在《多布斯诉杰克逊》案裁定《罗伊》案无效不足九个月后，牙买加诊所的**流产**服务已经开始运营。

This is one of the more unexpected results of the Supreme Court’s decision in 2022 to overturn *Roe*, a ruling that returned the issue of abortion to states and triggered bans. That gave the city’s government new energy to take a more active role in co-ordinating access to abortion, says the city’s health commissioner, Ashwin Vasan. This included putting up billboards in Arizona and Texas and opening clinics in underserved pockets of the city. Less than nine months after *Dobbs v Jackson*, the ruling that overturned *Roe,* the Jamaica clinic’s abortion service was up and running.

许多障碍——包括实际、财政、社会方面的——可能阻碍妇女，即使在**流产**合法的情况下也是如此。《多布斯》案的一个后果是那些对**流产**持支持态度的州提高了访问性。

Many hurdles—practical, financial, social—can stand in a woman’s way, even where abortion is legal. One consequence of *Dobbs* is improved access in states with a supportive approach to abortion.

来自支持**流产**权利的古德马赫研究所的新数据估计，2023年在美国进行了100万多次**流产**，与2020年相比增长了10%，是十多年来的最高数字。这一数字令人吃惊，考虑到该程序现在在14个州被禁止，并在其他若干州受到限制。与实施禁令的州接壤的州有最大幅度的增长：自2020年以来，在伊利诺伊州增长了72%，弗吉尼亚州增长了76%，新墨西哥州增长了257%。

New data from the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion-rights research group, estimate that over 1m abortions were performed in America in 2023—a rise of 10% compared with 2020 and the highest number in over a decade. This is astonishing, given that the procedure is now banned in 14 states and has become restricted in several more. States bordering those with bans had the steepest rises: up by 72% in Illinois since 2020, 76% in Virginia and 257% in New Mexico.

去年，超过160,000名妇女——每天超过400人——跨越州界终止怀孕，而2020年这一数字为81,100人（尽管是疫情流行年）。更令人惊讶的是在支持**流产**的州居民的增长。在加利福尼亚州，当地居民2023年的**流产**数量比2020年多了21,470次（占该州增长的88%），在纽约州，他们增加了20,460次（97%）。总体而言，在没有禁令的州，一半以上的增长是当地居民进行更多次**流产**导致的。

Last year more than 160,000 women—over 400 a day—crossed state borders to terminate pregnancies, versus 81,100 in 2020 (albeit a covid-19 year). More surprising is the growth among residents of abortion-supporting states. In California locals had an estimated 21,470 more abortions in 2023 than in 2020 (accounting for 88% of the state’s increase) and in New York they had 20,460 more (97%). Overall, in states without bans, over half of the rise was the result of locals having more abortions.

努力改善这些州的访问性也许可以解释这种增长。一些州已经减少了患者的自费开支。根据健康研究组织KFF发布的即将公布的分析，伊利诺伊州、新墨西哥州和纽约州增加了对第一和第二孕期**流产**手术的医疗补偿率逾200%。现在十个州的健康保险公司都被要求提供**流产**保险，而在多布斯案之前，这一数字为六个。

Efforts to improve access in such states may help explain this growth. Several states have reduced out-of-pocket spending for patients. Illinois, New Mexico and New York have increased their Medicaid reimbursement rates for first- and second-trimester abortion procedures by more than 200%, according to forthcoming analysis by KFF, a health-research group. In ten states health insurers are now required to cover abortion, up from six before *Dobbs*.

没有任何事物像**流产**药物一样帮助扩大访问范围，药物现在在美国**流产**中占63%，相比2019年增加了45%（见图表）。药物**流产**比手术**流产**更便宜，诊所更容易提供，并且患者接收起来更容易（尤其在农村地区）。在94%的**流产**发生在第一孕期时，药物**流产**效果很好。疫情期间的远程医疗实验推动了这种扩大，以及对其使用和分发的法规放宽。下周最高法院将考虑是否应再次收紧规定。

Nothing has helped expand access as much as abortion pills, which now account for 63% of abortions in America, up from 45% in 2019 (see chart). Medication abortions are cheaper than procedural ones, and easier for clinics to provide and (especially in rural areas) for patients to receive. They are effective in the first trimester, when 94% of abortions happen. Telehealth experiments during the pandemic helped fuel the expansion, as did a loosening of regulations on their use and distribution. Next week the [Supreme Court](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/21/the-supreme-court-hears-its-first-abortion-case-since-ending-roe) will consider whether the rules should be tightened again.

到2020年只有7%的医疗机构通过远程医疗提供**流产**服务，到2022年增加到31%。来自Hey Jane——一个仅提供虚拟**流产**服务的机构的麦佛莱明说，她可以提供“比实体诊所便宜得多”的药物**流产**。她看到了来自那些与限制州接壤的州，如科罗拉多、伊利诺伊和新墨西哥的订单特别大幅增加。

Whereas in 2020 only 7% of providers offered abortions via telemedicine, by 2022 that had increased to 31%. Mai Fleming from Hey Jane, a virtual-only abortion provider, says she can offer medication abortions at “a fraction” of the cost of bricks-and-mortar clinics. She has seen particularly large increases in orders from states that border restrictive states, such as Colorado, Illinois and New Mexico.

**流产**避难所还加强了对患者（例如数据隐私）和医疗服务提供者（例如医疗事故保险）的法律保护。一些州已经修改了州宪法以包括**流产**权利。现在有六个州有远程医疗保护法律，保护持牌从业者如果他们向禁止**流产**的州的患者开药并寄送药片，不被起诉。

Abortion havens have also solidified legal protections, both for patients (eg, data privacy) and providers (eg, malpractice insurance). Some have amended state constitutions to include a right to abortion. Six states now have telemedicine shield laws that protect licensed practitioners from prosecution if they prescribe and send pills to patients in states that ban abortion.

除了药物传播和降低障碍的努力外，对于全国**流产**数量上升的其他替代解释似乎站不住脚。例如，不是因为未经计划的怀孕激增，而是因为自《多布斯》以来几乎没什么变化。

Alternative explanations for the nationwide rise in abortions, beyond the spread of pills and efforts to lower barriers, do not seem to hold water. It does not, for example, appear to stem from a spike in unplanned pregnancies, which—a short bump during the covid pandemic excepted—show little sign of change since *Dobbs*.

认为在《罗伊》撤销后的美国一切都好转是错误的。药物**流产**可能是早期未经计划怀孕的救星，但对于那些需要后期**流产**的因胎儿异常在20周扫描中被检测出来的州的女性来说，获得**流产**比几十年前更加困难。■

It would be wrong to conclude that all is fine in post-*Roe* America. Abortion pills may be a godsend for early unplanned pregnancies, but for women in states with bans who need an abortion later—often due to fetal abnormalities detected at the 20-week scan—getting an abortion is harder than it has been for decades.■

本雅明·内塔尼亚胡正在疏远以色列最好的朋友 (Binyamin Netanyahu is alienating Israel’s best friends)
===========================================================================

参议员查克·舒默的里程碑演讲的意义 (The meaning of Senator Chuck Schumer’s landmark speech)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

![插图：查尔斯·舒默和本雅明·内塔尼亚胡。查克举起手指，比比拉着舌头。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_USD000.jpg)

30多年前的一天，在乔治·H·W·布什总统的任期内，国务卿詹姆斯·贝克向助手丹尼尔·柯策扔了一篇报纸文章，并宣布他将驱逐以色列大使。他对以色列副外长本雅明·内塔尼亚胡的一句引述感到愤怒。

One day more than 30 years ago, during the administration of President George H.W. Bush, the secretary of state, James Baker, flung a newspaper article at an aide, Daniel Kurtzer, and declared he was going to eject the Israeli ambassador. He was furious about a quotation he had just read from the deputy foreign minister of Israel, Binyamin Netanyahu.

柯策求情，请求24小时的时间来核实引述是否准确。他得知内塔尼亚胡的措辞与报道有些不同，但仍然令人震惊：内塔尼亚胡曾说美国“在谎言和歪曲的基础上制定其政策”。大使获得了暂时缓刑，但贝克先生宣布内塔尼亚胡为不受欢迎人物，并禁止他进入国务院。

Mr Kurtzer pleaded for 24 hours to check that the quotation was accurate. He learned that Mr Netanyahu’s wording was slightly different from what had been reported, but still shocking: America, Mr Netanyahu had said, “is building its policy on a foundation of distortions and lies”. The ambassador got a reprieve, but Mr Baker declared Mr Netanyahu persona non grata and banned him from the State Department.

几年后，1996年，内塔尼亚胡成为总理，轮到了比尔·克林顿总统受到侮辱。“他以为自己是谁？”在与内塔尼亚胡首次会面期间收到一场关于如何对待阿拉伯人的训诫后，克林顿总统向助手们发泄不满。“到底是哪个超级大国？”

A few years later, in 1996, Mr Netanyahu became prime minister, and it was President Bill Clinton’s turn to be insulted. “Who the fuck does he think he is?” Mr Clinton vented to aides, after receiving a lecture on how to deal with Arabs during his first meeting with Mr Netanyahu. “Who’s the fucking superpower here?”

即使是唐纳德·特朗普，作为总统一次又一次实现内塔尼亚胡的心愿，也发现自己被内塔尼亚胡经典的限制美国行动策略所击倒。当两人出现在白宫东厅宣布一项未经巴勒斯坦参与达成的和平计划——该计划毫无进展——时，内塔尼亚胡宣布这意味着以色列现在可以吞并被占领的约旦河西岸的部分地区。“这不是我们谈判的内容，”特朗普的女婿兼首席谈判代表贾瑞德·库什纳事后在他的回忆录《打破历史》中写道。“我用力抓住椅子，手指关节变得白皙得就好像我的紧握能让比比停下来一样。”

Even Donald Trump, who as president delivered item after item on Mr Netanyahu’s wish-list, found himself blindsided by a classic Netanyahu manoeuvre to box America in. When the two men appeared in the East Room of the White House to announce a peace plan they had arrived at without Palestinian participation—the plan went nowhere—Mr Netanyahu declared it meant Israel could now annex parts of the occupied West Bank. “This was not what we had negotiated,” a flabbergasted Jared Kushner, Mr Trump’s son-in-law and lead negotiator, would later write in his memoir, “Breaking History”. “I grabbed my chair so intensely that my knuckles turned white, as if my grip could make Bibi stop.”

远不及经验不足的库什纳先生，拜登总统有理由希望他的控制力足以制约总理，几十年来他们一直在交锋和开玩笑，早在贝克先生实施禁令之前。但自从哈马斯于10月7日闯入以色列以来，内塔尼亚胡一再拒绝了拜登关于战争的建议，并蔑视了他所提出的战后愿景。这导致了参议院多数领袖查克·舒默在3月14日做出了一次非同寻常而痛心疾首的演讲，指出内塔尼亚胡与哈马斯一样成为和平的障碍，并呼吁以色列举行选举罢免他。他说内塔尼亚胡“已经迷失了自己”。

Far more than the unpractised Mr Kushner, President Joe Biden had reason to hope that his grip would be enough to restrain the prime minister, whom he had alternately jousted and joked with for decades, since back before Mr Baker imposed his ban. But since Hamas’s rampage into Israel on October 7th, Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected Mr Biden’s counsel about the war and scorned his vision for its aftermath. That is what provoked Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, to give an extraordinary, anguished speech on March 14th naming Mr Netanyahu along with Hamas as an obstacle to peace and calling for an Israeli election to oust him. Mr Netanyahu, he said, “has lost his way”.

内塔尼亚胡和其他以色列人会犯一个错误，将这次演讲解读为盟国自以为是道路上的又一次波折。“这是非常不同的，”曾担任美国驻开罗和特拉维夫大使的柯策表示，“以色列人需要明白，这是一个警钟，如果没什么能说服他们出现问题，这一次就够了。”

Mr Netanyahu and other Israelis would be making a mistake to interpret the speech as just another bump in the often rocky road the allies have travelled since the founding of Israel. “This is very different,” says Mr Kurtzer, who went on to serve as the American ambassador in Cairo and then Tel Aviv. “The Israelis will need to understand that this is a wake-up call, if nothing else has persuaded them that they’re running into a problem with us.”

身为美国历史上最高级别的犹太选民官员，舒默先生并非以色列的朋友。在内塔尼亚胡公开抨击巴拉克·奥巴马政府提出的与伊朗核协议时在国会联席会议上发表讲话时激怒奥巴马白宫之时，舒默是仅有的四名参议院民主党人之一反对该协议。舒默先生也不是激进分子。现年73岁的他在演讲中强调，“与一些年轻美国人不同”，他是“在大屠杀活生生记忆中的一代”。他描述自己在高中时把晶体收音机按在耳朵上，恐惧地追踪六日战争的新闻。

Mr Schumer, the highest-ranking elected Jewish official in American history, is no fair-weather friend of Israel. Back when Mr Netanyahu outraged Barack Obama’s White House by attacking Mr Obama’s proposed nuclear deal with Iran in a speech to a joint session of Congress, Mr Schumer was one of only four Senate Democrats to vote against the deal. Mr Schumer is also no progressive. Now aged 73, he was at pains in his speech to point out that “unlike some younger Americans” he was of a generation “within living memory of the Holocaust”. He described pressing a transistor radio to his ear at high school as he fearfully tracked news of the Six Day War.

舒默先生是个政治动物，对周围的危险敏锐无比，但他极有可能不是在担心拜登在密歇根州的胜选机会。内塔尼亚胡应该担心的是，考虑到舒默的政治敏感性，他在称自己代表“默默无闻的犹太美国人”时是正确的，他说这些人“对以色列情有独钟”，但对加沙战争持有一种具有细腻视角的看法。舒默先生一再谴责哈马斯和新闻媒体中对巴勒斯坦人苦难完全归咎于以色列的双重标准。但他表示，以色列和美国都有“道义义务”要做更多来保护巴勒斯坦平民：“我们必须比我们的敌人更优秀，免得沦为他们。”

Mr Schumer is a political animal, as alert to danger in his surroundings as they come, but it is doubtful that he was worrying about Mr Biden’s chances of winning Michigan. Mr Netanyahu should worry instead that, given Mr Schumer’s political sophistication, he was correct in saying he spoke for “a silent majority” of Jewish Americans, people, he said, “who love Israel to our bones” yet take a nuanced view of the war in Gaza. Mr Schumer repeatedly condemned Hamas and a double standard in the news media that put all the blame for Palestinian suffering on Israel. But, he said, both Israel and the United States had a “moral obligation” to do more to protect Palestinian civilians: “We must be better than our enemies, lest we become them.”

内塔尼亚胡于3月17日回应称，现在呼吁在以色列举行选举就像在2001年9月11日袭击之后就呼吁在美国举行选举。“你不应这样对待一个姐妹民主国家，对待一个盟友，”他告诉CNN。但拜登明确表示赞同舒默的立场。他告诉记者，“他讲了一篇精彩的演讲。”

Mr Netanyahu responded on March 17th by saying that calling for elections in Israel now would be like having called for elections in America in the wake of the attacks of September 11th 2001. “You don’t do that to a sister democracy, to an ally,” he told cNN. But Mr Biden has made clear that he approved of Mr Schumer’s message. “He made a good speech,” he told reporters.

内塔尼亚胡在美国部分成长和接受教育，为自己能够理解如何应对美国政治感到自豪。“我知道美国是什么，”他曾说，显然不知道自己被录音。“美国是一件你可以很容易搬动的东西。”也许这一次不行。鉴于外交政策的两极化，他可以指望共和党的支持，但以色列一直以来对美国的两党支持一直是其安全的堡垒，如今失去了舒默先生，内塔尼亚胡已经基本失去了民主党的支持。

Mr Netanyahu was partly brought up and educated in America, and he prides himself on understanding how to manage its politics. “I know what America is,” he remarked once, apparently unaware he was being recorded. “America is a thing you can move very easily.” Maybe not this time. Given the polarisation of foreign policy, he can count on Republican backing, but bipartisan support of Israel has always been a bulwark of its security and, having lost Mr Schumer, Mr Netanyahu has all but lost the Democrats.

甚至在舒默发表演讲之前，拜登已经将自己逼入困境，他表示，如果以色列军队在加沙地带南部的拉法进行大规模行动，他们将跨越“一道红线”。他要求以色列提供“可信可靠”的保证，确保其使用军事援助符合国际人道主义法规。美国很快将决定他们是否对这些承诺感到满意。若发现以色列在滥用美国武器，舒默已经极大地加强了拜登的立场。美国领导人的愤怒是针对内塔尼亚胡的，但最终可能会使以色列付出代价。 ■

Even before Mr Schumer spoke, Mr Biden had boxed himself in, saying if Israeli forces conducted a major operation in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip they would be crossing “a red line”. He has required “credible and reliable” assurances from Israel that it is using military aid in compliance with international humanitarian law. The Americans will soon decide whether they are satisfied with those assurances. Mr Schumer has dramatically strengthened Mr Biden’s hand, should he choose to find Israel is misusing American weapons. The anger of America’s leaders is directed at Mr Netanyahu, but Israel may wind up paying the price. ■

============================================================

他的SPAC的投资者可能会被烧伤，但他们似乎并不在乎。 (Investors in his SPAC may get burned, but they don’t seem to mind)

在互联网的一个激情四射的角落，**MAGA死忠们**聚集在一起讨论政治、上帝和股市。在Reddit和Rumble（一种极右翼的YouTube），他们热情讨论着自己的主人唐纳德·特朗普及其社交媒体公司**Truth Social**，他们祈祷着通过一家[特殊目的收购公司](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/04/12/what-is-a-spac)（SPAC）很快上市。他们一起研究公司最新在证券交易委员会（SEC）的申报文件，然后读几节圣经经文。一句旧约箴言——“买真理，不可卖”，简直太贴切了。“这就是我们在这里做的事，伙计们，”Rumble上的炒热情人**查德·内多希**说。“从字面上讲，作为一群投资者，我们相信真理，我们永不出售，因为我们是手中紧握钻石的HODL者”。这是加密行话，意为“紧紧抓住，无论如何”。

There is a spirited corner of the internet where MAGA die-hards go to talk politics, God and the stockmarket. On Reddit and Rumble (a kind of far-right YouTube) they pump up their man Donald Trump and his social-media company, Truth Social, which they pray will soon go public via a [special-purpose acquisition company](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/04/12/what-is-a-spac) (SPAC). Together they pore over its latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), then they read a Bible verse or two. One Old Testament proverb—“Buy the truth and do not sell it”—is almost too apt. “That’s what we’re doing here, folks,” says Chad Nedohin, a hype-man on Rumble. “Literally, as a team of investors, we have bought into truth and we are never selling because we are diamond-handed HODLers”. That is crypto-speak for “hold on for dear life”.

信仰是这群**模因股票交易者**的必备条件。**Truth Social**通往公开市场的道路漫长而充满挑战，围绕它有SEC的调查、前员工的诉讼和资金短缺问题。最终，一场上市看起来已近在眼前。在3月22日，一家特殊目的收购公司（SPAC）——名为[数字世界收购公司](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/12/11/donald-trumps-media-spac-is-the-zeitgeist-wrapped-in-a-complex-financial-instrument)（DWAC）的投资者将就是否与**Truth Social**的母公司特朗普传媒技术集团合并进行投票。如果有足够多的同意意见，合并后的公司将开始在纳斯达克交易所以**DJT**的代号进行交易。

Faith is a prerequisite for this merry band of meme-stock traders. Truth Social’s path to the public markets has been long and fraught, dogged by an SEC probe, lawsuits by disgruntled former employees and a cash crunch. At last a flotation looks imminent. On March 22nd investors in a SPAC—a listed pot of capital—called [Digital World Acquisition Corp](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/12/11/donald-trumps-media-spac-is-the-zeitgeist-wrapped-in-a-complex-financial-instrument) (DWAC) will vote on whether to merge with Truth Social’s parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group. If enough assent the combined firm will start trading under the NASDAQ ticker DJT.

这笔交易来得正是时候。特朗普传媒陷入困境：去年前三个季度亏损了4900万美元，截至9月还仅有180万美元现金。通过这次合并，特朗普传媒将筹集大约2.4亿美元，据纽约大学法学院的**迈克尔·奥尔罗格**估计，以**DWAC**当前的股价计算，新实体的市值将达到63亿美元。与其他**模因股票**一样，这毫无经济意义。该公司已经报告有890万人注册了**Truth Social**，但喜欢不透露每日活跃用户数量。“专注于这些关键绩效指标可能不符合**特朗普传媒**的最佳利益，” 其招股书中说。

The deal comes at an opportune time. Trump Media is running on fumes: in the first three quarters of last year it lost $49m and had just $1.8m cash on hand as of September. Through the merger it will raise about $240m, estimates Michael Ohlrogge of New York University School of Law. At DWAC’s current share price the new entity will have a market capitalisation of $6.3bn. As with other meme stocks, that makes no economic sense. The firm has reported 8.9m sign-ups for Truth Social but prefers not to disclose how many are active daily. “Focusing on these KPIs might not align with the best interests” of Trump Media, says its prospectus.

特朗普先生将拥有价值41亿美元的股份。但为期六个月的锁定期内，他无法出售，纸面收益在他目前的流动性危机中毫无用处。今年2月，特朗普先生因其[房地产业务](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/17/the-consequences-of-donald-trumps-huge-fine-for-fraud)上的欺诈行为被罚了近50亿美元；截至3月25日，他必须为这笔金额提供一个保证金。这一点变得棘手：大约30家担保公司迄今已将他拒之门外，因为他缺乏足够的现金作为抵押品。他已经要求上诉法院减少保证金。如果被拒绝，他将不得不出售资产或请求一位富有的支持者帮助他。如果失败，起诉他的检察官**莱蒂西亚·詹姆斯**可能会冻结他的银行账户或查封他的一些财产。她喜欢说，她能从她的办公室看到特朗普先生大厦之一的华尔街40号。

Mr Trump will own a stake worth $4.1bn. But a six-month lock-up, during which he cannot sell, makes paper gains of little use in his present liquidity crunch. In February Mr Trump was fined nearly half a billion dollars for fraud at his [property business](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/17/the-consequences-of-donald-trumps-huge-fine-for-fraud); by March 25th he must secure a bond for that amount while he appeals against the judgment.

至于**DJT**，经济现实最终应该会浮出水面。如果特朗普先生清算他的持股，股价将会下跌。从2019年开始，合并目标公司后，十只SPAC中就有九只价值下跌，斯坦福法学院的**迈克尔·克劳斯纳**指出。平均而言，合并后的SPAC股价下跌了60%。在这些合并中，被收购的公司获得了很划算的交易，而坚持到上市的SPAC股东——主要是不成熟的散户投资者——则蒙受了损失。

That is proving tricky: about 30 bond companies have turned him down so far because he lacks enough cash to put up as collateral. He has asked an appeals court to reduce the bond. If it refuses he will have to sell assets or ask a rich supporter to bail him out. Failing that Letitia James, the prosecutor who brought the case, could freeze his bank accounts or seize some of his property. She likes to say that she can see 40 Wall Street, one of Mr Trump’s towers, from her office.

**DJT**队伍听到了批评者的声音；他们只是认为他们是错的。早在2022年，当SEC调查这笔交易时，Rumble的炒热情人内多希先生坚称特朗普传媒并非庞氏骗局。“这是不同的，”他向他兴奋的追随者们保证。“我们正在帮助推广一家有潜力很容易达到万亿美元价值的公司…它将会付出！” ■

As for DJT, economic reality should sink in eventually. If and when Mr Trump liquidates his holdings the share price will drop. Since the beginning of 2019 nine out of ten SPACs have lost value after combining with their target company, notes Michael Klausner of Stanford Law School. On average the share prices of post-merger SPACs have declined by 60%. Target companies got a good deal in these mergers while SPAC shareholders who stuck through the listing—mostly unsophisticated retail investors—took a bath.

The DJT crowd hears the critics; it just thinks they are wrong. Back in 2022, when the SEC was investigating the deal, Mr Nedohin, the Rumble hype-man, insisted that Trump Media was not a Ponzi scheme. “This is different,” he assured his excitable followers. “We are helping promote a company that has the potential to be a trillion dollars easily…It will be paying out!” ■

![Illustration of a person holding a gavel and sitting in front of a stack of pills.](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_USD002.jpg)

**插图展示了一个人手持拍板坐在一堆药丸前面。**

Nearly two-thirds of the Americans who choose to end their pregnancies now do so using pills. [Medication abortion](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/19/fewer-states-allow-abortions-yet-american-women-are-having-more) has been an increasingly popular option since 2000, when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved mifepristone as part of a two-drug regimen with misoprostol. More recently, the FDA widened the window during which the medicine may be used and eased dispensing requirements. But on March 26th the Supreme Court will consider whether these loosened regulations should be tightened back up.

现在，近三分之二选择结束怀孕的美国人使用**药物流产**。自2000年以来，**药物流产**已成为一种越来越受欢迎的选择，当时食品和药物管理局(FDA)首次批准米非司酮与米索前列醇联合使用。最近，FDA扩大了可以使用这种药物的时间窗口并放宽了分发要求。但是在3月26日，最高法院将考虑是否应该收紧这些放宽的法规。

*FDA v Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine* began as an assault on the FDA’s original approval of mifepristone. In April 2023 the district-court judge in Texas who heard the case invalidated the authorisation from 2000 and each of the subsequent liberalisations. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals kept mifepristone on the shelves when it pared back this extraordinary ruling last August. But the appeals court agreed that the 2016 and 2021 changes—allowing the drug to be used through ten weeks of pregnancy (up from seven) and to be sent to women by post with a remote prescription—had to go.

*FDA对抗赫罗德医学联盟* 最初是针对FDA对米非司酮的原始批准的抨击。2023年4月，德克萨斯州地方法院法官无效了2000年的授权以及随后所有的自由化举措。在去年8月，第五巡回上诉法院削减了这个卓越的裁决时，维持了米非司酮在市场上的地位。但上诉法院同意2016年和2021年的变更——允许该药物在怀孕十周内（从七周提高）使用，并且可以通过邮寄及远程处方发给女性的规定必须废除。

The plaintiffs will be represented at the Supreme Court by Erin Hawley, wife of Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. They contend that the FDA violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a law governing how agencies operate, when it expanded access to the purportedly “high risk” drug in 2016 and 2021. The changes in 2016 followed a “piecemeal analysis” of insufficient data, the Alliance writes, and the action of 2021 relied on “unreliable” information. Lifting “long-existing and common-sense safety standards” was “arbitrary and capricious” and thus “unreasonable”.

原告将由密苏里州参议员Josh Hawley的妻子Erin Hawley在最高法院代表。他们主张FDA在2016年和2021年扩大使用这种据称“高风险”药物的做法违反了《行政程序法》，该法规定了机构运作的方式。联盟写道，2016年的变化是基于“片面的不充分数据分析”，而2021年的行动则依赖于“不可靠”的信息。取消“长期存在的和常识性的安全标准”是“武断和反常”的，因此是“不合理的”。

The federal government and Danco, which markets mifepristone as Mifeprex, paint the FDA’s decisions in a rosier light. The move in 2016 was based on “an enormous and highly reliable data set”, the government says. The decision to allow pills-by-post in 2021 was informed by “extensive published literature”, plus more than two decades of women safely using mifepristone. Emergencies arise in at most 0.7% of cases, making the medicine safer than Viagra or penicillin.

联邦政府和市场化米非司酮为“米费普雷克斯”的丹科公司，将FDA的决定描绘为积极的一面。政府表示，2016年的举措是基于“庞大和高度可靠的数据集”。允许在2021年通过邮寄发放药丸的决定是基于“大量已发表的文献”，以及超过二十年来女性安全使用米非司酮的经验。在多少情况下出现紧急情况，药物的安全性比**伟哥**或者青霉素更安全，最多占0.7%。

The two sides will surely debate the wisdom of the FDA’s moves in next week’s oral argument. But the question of standing could dominate the conversation: whether the challengers have the legal right to bring the case. The Supreme Court has held that fierce opposition to a policy is no grounds to sue the government. Litigants must show they have suffered a “concrete injury” with a clear causal link.

双方将在下周的口头辩论中确保辩论FDA的决定智慧。但是关于立场的问题可能主导讨论：挑战者是否有合法权利提起诉讼。最高法院裁定，对政策的激烈反对并不是起诉政府的理由。诉讼人必须证明他们遭受了“明确的损害”，并且有明显的因果关系。

The plaintiffs advance a host of arguments to claim standing. Their main contention is reminiscent of a Rube Goldberg machine: pro-life doctors could be forced to violate their conscience if no one else is available to complete terminations for women rushed to the emergency room after complications from a medical abortion prescribed elsewhere. This “long chain of contingencies” stemming from “an exceedingly rare serious adverse event” is purely speculative, the government argues: the plaintiffs have not named “even a single doctor among their thousands of members who has ever been required to perform an abortion in the decades mifepristone has been on the market”.

原告提出了大量论点来主张其立场。他们的主要观点让人想起鲁伯·戈尔德堡机器：反堕胎的医生可能被迫违背良心，如果紧急情况下没有其他人可以为因服用其他地方开出的药物流产而导致并发症送往急诊室的女性完成终止妊娠。政府辩护说，这种起源于“一次极为罕见的严重不良事件”的“一长串偶发事件”纯粹是臆测：原告中尚未提及“在米非司酮上市几十年来，甚至在成千上万的成员中，甚至一个医生曾被迫履行堕胎手术”。

The Supreme Court arguably bent the rules of standing last year in a case that dashed President Joe Biden’s plan to cancel student loans. But the winding argument from mifepristone’s foes*—*and the legal adventurism of the lower courts—may stretch too far even for the five justices who dispatched *Roe v Wade* in 2022.■

在去年的案例中，最高法院可以说是打破了立场的规则，这个案例让总统乔•拜登的取消学生贷款计划落空。但是关于米非司酮反对者的复杂论点—以及下级法院的法律冒险行为—甚至可能对于在**2022年废除**《罗伊诉韦德**（Roe v Wade）**的五位大法官来说也太超出范围了。■

美国最强大的教师工会是不是走得太远了？ (Is the most powerful teachers union in America overreaching?)
===============================================================================

芝加哥的教师已成为激进左翼组织的典范。 (Chicago’s teachers have become a model for radical left-wing organising)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![2019年芝加哥老师游行](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_USP003.jpg)

在选举之夜的派对中，情绪低迷。3月19日，芝加哥的初选选民被要求投票支持一项提案，该提案将提高房产转让税，针对价值超过100万美元的物业，以筹集资金用于支付无家可归者的救助。这一提案得到了该市整个**进步**建制的支持。而反对方大多来自房地产行业，甚至都没有组织对抗活动。但是到了选举之夜的9点，“否”票领先大约8个百分点。芝加哥无家可归者联盟的梅龙·伯德（Myron Byrd）在悲伤地说，“让我们假装”，然后唱出他想要为庆祝胜利表演的歌曲。派对以“我们不会放弃”的呼喊声结束，即使大多数与会者已经放弃离开。

As election-night parties go, the mood was bleak. On March 19th primary-election voters in Chicago were asked to vote on a ballot measure that would have raised the transfer tax on properties worth over $1m so as to generate money to pay for homelessness relief. The measure was backed by the city’s entire progressive establishment. Its opponents, mostly from the real-estate industry, did not even bother to organise a rival event. And yet by 9pm on election night, “No” was leading by around eight percentage points. “Let’s just pretend,” said Myron Byrd, from the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, an activist group, mournfully, before he belted out a song he had wanted to perform to celebrate victory. The party ended with chants of “we will not give up”, long after most attendees gave up and left.

“**将芝加哥带回家**”提案的失败对芝加哥市长布兰登·约翰逊（Brandon Johnson）来说是沉重的打击，因为他曾为此大力宣传。但对于他的前雇主芝加哥教师工会（CTU）而言，这或许更是一个更大的挫折，该工会为拉动赞成票投入了40万美元，并动员了其2.8万名成员。在过去的十年左右的时间里，该工会通过采取激进左翼政治组织模式，已成为美国最强大的工会之一。从2022年到去年年底，该工会向约翰逊的竞选基金投入了230万美元。它的支持帮助将约翰逊先生，此前是一个鲜为人知的县委员，推上了市长之位。今年，它希望收获果实——教师的合同将要续约。但这个工会是否贪得无厌呢？

The defeat of the “Bring Chicago Home” measure was crushing for Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, who had heavily promoted it. But it is perhaps an even bigger defeat for his former employer, the Chicago Teachers Union (ctu), which put $400,000 and the organising work of its 28,000 members into getting a Yes vote. In the past decade or so, the union has become one of the most powerful in the country by adopting a model of radical left-wing political organising. From 2022 to the end of last year it put $2.3m into Mr Johnson’s campaign fund. Its support helped elevate Mr Johnson, previously an unknown county commissioner, into office. This year it hopes to reap the spoils—the teachers’ contract is up for renewal. But is the union overreaching?

CTU的转变始于十多年前，当时拉姆·伊曼纽尔（Rahm Emanuel）担任市长。伊曼纽尔上任后发现教师养老金计划出现巨大缺口，便取消了加薪，并采取了强硬的谈判态度。2012年，愤怒的教师们首次罢工，打破了25年来的停工记录。2013年，他开始了一个极具争议的计划，关闭该市50所公立学校，进一步激发了工会的组织力量。经过2019年的另一次罢工，到去年为止，该工会已经发展出足够的信心，帮助赶走了伊曼纽尔的继任者洛瑞·莱特芬特（Lori Lightfoot）。

The ctu’s transformation began over a decade ago, when Rahm Emanuel was mayor. On coming into office and discovering a huge hole in the teachers’ pension scheme, Mr Emanuel cancelled a pay rise and took a hardline approach to negotiation. In 2012 incensed teachers went on strike for the first time in 25 years. In 2013 he then began a deeply controversial programme to close 50 of the city’s public schools, further invigorating the union’s organising efforts. After another strike in 2019, by last year it had developed the confidence to help push out Mr Emanuel’s successor, Lori Lightfoot.

如今，由于约翰逊先生在位，CTU的地位十分优越。今年，教师们将和他们自己工会的前游说者谈判，而不是像莱特芬特女士或伊曼纽尔先生那样。他们期待着获益。三月初，右翼智库伊利诺伊政策研究所（IPI）泄露了工会的早期谈判提议。建议之一是教师们每年应该获得9%的“物价”涨幅、住房补贴、更慷慨的养老金和小额药费的医疗保险。该工会还希望该市每所学校都能保证有图书管理员，并雇佣更多各类员工。“他们几乎可以要求任何事情，”伊利诺伊政策研究所的奥斯汀·伯格说道。

With Mr Johnson in office, the ctu is in an enviable position. Instead of dealing with somebody like Ms Lightfoot or Mr Emanuel, this year teachers will negotiate with their own union’s former lobbyist. They expect a payoff. In early March the Illinois Policy Institute (IPI), a right-leaning think-tank, leaked the union’s early negotiating proposals. Among the suggestions were that teachers ought to get “cost of living” pay increases of 9% a year, subsidised housing, more generous pensions, and health insurance with smaller copays. The union also wants every school in the city to be guaranteed a librarian and more staff of all sorts to be hired. “They can demand almost anything under the sun,” says Austin Berg, of the IPI.

工会认为这只是应得之举。工会的领导是前历史教师斯泰西·戴维斯·盖茨（Stacy Davis Gates），她说她因学校关闭而受到激励。戴维斯·盖茨在政治上采取毫不妥协的态度。在3月5日在城市俱乐部对大人物们的讲话中，她告诉那些对学区如何为她工会的提议支付费用而感到困惑的记者们“停止问那个问题”。她还谈到了当被曝出她把她的十几岁儿子送去私立天主教学校而不是公立学校时，这对她的精神健康造成了何种影响。在演讲结束时，她最终给出了她提案的费用数字：“500亿美元和三分钱”。

The union sees this as only what it is due. At its head is Stacy Davis Gates, a former history teacher who says she was radicalised by school closures. Ms Davis Gates takes a no-compromise approach to politics. In a speech to bigwigs at the City Club on March 5th she told journalists wondering about how the district would pay for her union’s proposals to “stop asking that question”. She also discussed the toll it took on her mental health to have it revealed she sends her teenage son to a private Catholic school, rather than a public one. At the end of the speech she finally offered a figure for the cost of her proposals: “$50bn and three cents”.

问题在于没有更多的资金了。今年的预算每名学生为2.9万美元。这样的支出仅仅得益于大量的联邦新冠疫情救助资金。到2026年，学区预计会出现6.91亿美元的赤字，甚至在考虑到新合同的成本之前。他们不能再快速提高物业税了。慈善机构芝加哥优先儿童组织的哈尔·伍兹（Hal Woods）表示，州政府援助不太可能。这只留下了同样资金紧张的城市。甚至有些曾经对工会持同情态度的人也感到紧张。“他们试图通过向其投入资金解决过去二三十年的错误政策决策，”路斯福大学的学者斯蒂芬妮·法尔默说，“这让我感到非常失望。”

The trouble is there is no more money. This year the budget amounts to $29,000 per pupil. Such spending is possible only thanks to a huge slug of federal covid-relief funding. By 2026 the school district projects it will have a deficit of $691m even before the costs of a new contract. It cannot raise its property tax any faster. A state bailout is unlikely, says Hal Woods of Kids First Chicago, a charity. That leaves only the equally cash-strapped city. Even some once sympathetic to the ctu are nervous. “They are trying to solve the bad policy decisions of the past two or three decades by just throwing money at it,” says Stephanie Farmer, an academic at Roosevelt University. “It makes me very disappointed.”

芝加哥的学校实际上需要改革。在现状下，即使投入了大量资金也很难有所作为。最大的问题之一是学校太多。过去二十年里，即使新的特许学校开设，入学率下降了超过四分之一。该市超过三分之一的学校的运营率低于50%。一些高中的学生人数甚至不到其建造所需人数的10%。超大型学校的运营成本高昂，即使它们不得不在服务上节衣缩食（比如图书管理员）。关闭这些学校会引起极大的反感，但工会的解决方案实质上等同于把它们当作满员来雇员。在谈判中，约翰逊先生面临着一个选择。如果他只是简单掏钱，那么他就必须削减其他城市服务的经费来支付这个费用。另一种选择则是对那些支持他当选的人说“不”。然而，在某种程度上，“将芝加哥带回家”投票结果可能会让这更容易。在去年的市长选举中，当被问及如何与教师谈判时，约翰逊先生回答道：“没有比朋友更适合向朋友传递坏消息的了。”如果你的朋友突然变得不那么受欢迎，这将会变得更容易。 ■

What Chicago’s schools actually need is reform. As things are, even large sums of money do not go especially far. One of the biggest problems is that there are simply too many schools. Over the past two decades enrolment has shrunk by over a quarter, even as new charter schools opened. Over a third of the city’s schools are operating at below 50% capacity. A few high schools have less than 10% of the number of students they were built for. Oversized schools cost huge sums to run even as they have to skimp on services (like librarians). Closing them would be fiercely unpopular, but the ctu’s solution in essence amounts to staffing them all as though they are full.

In the negotiations Mr Johnson has a choice. If he simply pays up, he will have to starve the rest of the city’s services to pay for it. The alternative is defying those who put him into office. And yet in a way, the results of the Bring Chicago Home ballot measure could make that easier. In the mayoral race last year, when asked about how he would negotiate with the teachers, Mr Johnson replied, “who better to deliver bad news to friends than a friend?” That becomes a lot easier if your friend suddenly seems a lot less popular. ■

企业在人工智能淘金热中究竟赚了多少钱？ (Just how rich are businesses getting in the AI gold rush?)
============================================================================

英伟达和微软并非唯一的赢家。 (Nvidia and Microsoft are not the only winners)
-----------------------------------------------------------

**人工智能（AI）**  的激动人心，几乎每天都有一家公司的市值因此飙升，这是再寻常不过的事情。这个月，硬件制造商戴尔的股价一天内暴涨超过30%，因为人们希望AI将推动销售额增长。几天后，云计算初创企业Together AI以新的估值13亿美元筹集了新的融资，高于去年11月的5亿美元。该公司的投资方包括 **Nvidia**，该公司是一家制造AI芯片的公司，自身正处于一轮持续的牛市之中。ChatGPT是一款“生成式”AI，它于2022年11月上市，能以令人惊讶的人类方式回答查询，在这之前，它的市值约为3000亿美元，类似于家装连锁店Home Depot。如今，它的市值已经达到2.3万亿美元，仅略低于苹果公司的5000亿美元。

Barely a day goes by without excitement over [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.economist.com/topics/artificial-intelligence) sending another company’s market value through the roof. This month the share price of Dell, a hardware-maker, jumped by over 30% in a day because of hopes that AI will boost sales. Days later Together AI, a cloud-computing startup, raised new funding at a valuation of $1.3bn, up from $500m in November. One of its investors is [Nvidia](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/02/27/why-do-nvidias-chips-dominate-the-ai-market), a maker of AI chips that is itself on an extended bull run. Before the launch in November 2022 of ChatGPT, a “generative” AI that responds to queries in uncannily humanlike ways, its market value was about $300bn, similar to that of Home Depot, a home-improvement chain. Today it is $2.3trn, $500bn or so shy of Apple’s.

大量 **AI** 标题的涌现让人很难确定在 **AI** 繁荣中哪些企业是真正的赢家，哪些将在未来更长的时间里胜出。为了帮助回答这个问题，《经济学人》审视了目前已经积累的价值及其在 **AI** “堆栈”中产品和服务预期销售的情况。技术人员称之为 **AI** 依赖的各种硬件和软件层。3月18日，许多堆栈内外的公司齐聚圣何塞，参加了由Nvidia主办的为期四天的盛会。从机器人技术到药物发现，这场盛会展示了最新的 **AI** 创新。它突显了堆栈内部公司之间的激烈竞争，而且越来越多地在它们之间展开。

The relentless stream of AI headlines makes it hard to get a sense of which businesses are real winners in the AI boom—and which will win in the longer run. To help answer this question *The Economist* has looked where value has accrued so far and how this tallies with the expected sales of products and services in the AI “stack”, as technologists call the various layers of hardware and software on which AI relies to work its magic. On March 18th many companies up and down the stack descended on San Jose for a four-day jamboree hosted by Nvidia. With talks on everything from robotics to drug discovery, the shindig showed off the latest AI innovations. It highlighted furious competition between firms within layers of the stack and, increasingly, between them.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_WBC964.png)

我们审视了四个这样的层及其所居其中的企业：在堆栈外销售的 **AI** 应用程序；诸如 **GPT-4**（ChatGPT背后的大脑）和它们的仓库（例如Hugging Face）之类的 **AI** 模型本身；托管许多这些模型和一些应用程序的云计算平台（Amazon Web Services、Google Cloud Platform、Microsoft Azure）；以及负责云计算能力的半导体（由AMD、Intel和Nvidia等公司制造）、服务器（戴尔）和网络设备（Arista）（参见图表1）。

We examined four of these layers and the firms that inhabit them: AI-powered applications sold outside the stack; the AI models themselves, such as GPT-4, the brain behind ChatGPT, and repositories of them (for example, Hugging Face); the cloud-computing platforms which host many of these models and some of the applications (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure); and the hardware, such as semiconductors (made by firms such as AMD, Intel and Nvidia), servers (Dell) and networking gear (Arista), responsible for the clouds’ computing power (see chart 1).

技术突破通常会推高新的科技巨头。20世纪80年代和90年代的个人计算机热潮推动了微软，该公司制造了Windows操作系统，以及英特尔，该公司则制造运行它所需芯片，成为企业界的佼佼者。根据投资银行杰富瑞的数据，到了2000年代，“Wintel”占据了个人电脑行业四分之四的操作利润。智能手机时代也对苹果产生了同样的影响。在2007年推出iPhone几年后，苹果已经占据了全球手机制造商一半以上的运营利润。

Technological breakthroughs tend to elevate new tech giants. The PC boom in the 1980s and 1990s propelled Microsoft, which made the Windows operating system, and Intel, which manufactured the chips needed to run it, to the top of the corporate pecking order. By the 2000s “Wintel” was capturing four-fifths of the operating profits from the PC industry, according to Jefferies, an investment bank. The smartphone era did the same to Apple. A few years after it launched the iPhone in 2007, it was raking in more than half of handset-makers’ global operating profits.

**生成式AI** 纪元还处于早期阶段，然而它已经赚得盆钵满盈。总体而言，我们审视的约100家公司自该纪元开始以来，已为业主创造了8万亿美元的价值，为本文的目的，我们将其定义为2022年10月，就在ChatGPT推出之前（请参见图表2）。这些收益并非全部是 **AI** 狂热的结果 - 近来股市整体表现强劲 - 但其中很多确实是。

The world is still in the early days of the generative-AI epoch. Even so, it has already been immensely lucrative. All told, the 100 or so companies that we examined have together created $8trn in value for their owners since its start—which, for the purposes of this article, we define as October 2022, just before the launch of ChatGPT (see chart 2). Not all these gains are the result of the AI frenzy—stockmarkets have been on a broader tear of late—but many are.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_WBC824.png)

在堆栈每个层面，价值正在变得更加集中。在硬件、模型制作和应用程序方面，最大的三家公司在过去一年半中在整体创造价值上的份额中位数增加了14个百分点。在云层面，与ChatGPT制造商OpenAI有合作关系的微软已经领先于亚马逊和Alphabet（Google的母公司）。在ChatGPT发布之前，它的市值现在占云三巨头总市值的46%，而在此之前占41%。

At every layer of the stack, value is becoming more concentrated. In hardware, model-making and applications, the biggest three companies have increased their share of overall value created by a median of 14 percentage points in the past year and a half. In the cloud layer Microsoft, which has a partnership with ChatGPT’s maker, OpenAI, has pulled ahead of Amazon and Alphabet (Google’s parent company). Its market capitalisation now accounts for 46% of the cloud trio’s total, up from 41% before the release of ChatGPT.

价值分配在层面之间也是不均匀的。就绝对值而言，大多数财富已经积累到了硬件制造商手中。这些包括半导体公司、制造服务器的公司以及制造网络设备的公司。在我们的样本中，2022年10月，27家上市硬件公司价值约为1.5万亿美元。如今这个数字已经达到5万亿美元。这在技术热潮中是可以理解的：基础物理架构首先需要建造，以便提供软件服务。正如20世纪90年代末，随着互联网热潮的开始，提供调制解调器等一些电信设备的公司，如思科和WorldCom，成为早期的赢家一样。

The spread of value is uneven between layers, too. In absolute terms the most riches have accrued to the hardware-makers. These include semiconductor firms, companies that build servers and those that make networking equipment. In October 2022 the 27 public hardware companies in our sample were worth around $1.5trn. Today that figure is $5trn. This is what you would expect in a technology boom: the underlying physical infrastructure needs to be built first in order for software to be offered. In the late 1990s, as the internet boom was getting going, providers of things like modems and other telecoms gubbins, such as Cisco and WorldCom, were the early winners.

迄今，圣何塞盛会的主办方绝对是最大的赢家。Nvidia贡献了我们硬件公司市值增长中约57%。根据市调公司IDC的数据，该公司占据了超过80%的AI芯片市场份额。该公司还几乎垄断了用于将芯片联接在数据中心内的AI服务器中的网络设备。截至1月底的12个月内，Nvidia的数据中心业务收入增长超过三倍。其毛利润率从59%增长到74%。

So far the host of the San Jose gabfest is by far the biggest victor. Nvidia accounts for some 57% of the increase in the market capitalisation of our hardware firms. The company makes more than 80% of all AI chips, according to IDC, a research firm. It also enjoys a near-monopoly in the networking equipment used to yoke the chips together inside the AI servers in data centres. Revenues from Nvidia’s data-centre business more than tripled in the 12 months to the end of January, compared with the year before. Its gross margins grew from 59% to 74%.

Nvidia的芯片制造竞争对手也想分一杯羹。像AMD和英特尔这样的老牌公司正在推出竞争产品。一些初创公司，如Groq，生产超快速的AI芯片，而Cerebras则生产超大规格的芯片。Nvidia的最大客户，三巨头云计算公司，也正在设计自己的芯片，作为减少对唯一供应商依赖和窃取Nvidia丰厚毛利的一种方式。AMD的首席执行官Lisa Su预计，到2027年，来自AI芯片销售的收入可能从2023年的450亿美元增长到4000亿美元。这个数字远远超过Nvidia独自承受的能力。

Nivdia’s chipmaking rivals want a piece of these riches. Established ones, such as AMD and Intel, are launching rival products. So are startups like Groq, which makes superfast AI chips, and Cerebras, which makes supersized ones. Nvidia’s biggest customers, the three cloud giants, are designing their own chips, too—as a way to reduce reliance on one provider and to steal some of Nvidia’s juicy margins for themselves. Lisa Su, chief executive of AMD, has forecast that revenues from the sale of AI chips could balloon to $400bn by 2027, from $45bn in 2023. That would be far too much for Nvidia alone to digest.

随着AI应用变得日益普及，需求的一部分将从用于训练模型所需的芯片转移，这些芯片包括分析大量数据以教会算法预测下一个单词或序列中的下一个像素。在过去一年中，NvidiaAI收入的40%来自于客户使用其芯片进行推理。专家们认为，将有一些推理移动从专用图形处理单元（GPU）转向通用中央处理单元，这些处理单元就是AMD和英特尔使用的，如笔记本电脑和智能手机使用的。不久以后，甚至一些训练可能会通过CPU而不是GPU进行。

As AI applications become widespread, a growing share of demand will shift from chips required for training models, which consists of analysing lots of data in order to teach algorithms to predict the next word or pixel in a sequence, to those needed to use them to respond to queries (“inference”, in tech-speak). In the past year two-fifths of Nvidia’s AI revenues came from customers using its chips for inference. Experts expect some inference to start moving from specialist graphics-processing units (GPUs), which are Nvidia’s forte, to general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) like those used in laptops and smartphones, which are AMD’s and Intel’s. Before long even some training may be done on CPUs rather than GPUs.

尽管如此，对硬件市场的影响，Nvidia在未来几年似乎是牢固的。没有业绩记录的初创公司将很难说服大客户为他们尚未经过测试的技术重新配置企业硬件系统。云计算巨头部署自己的芯片仍然有限。而 **Nvidia** 拥有CUDA，这是一个软件平台，允许客户根据自己的需求定制芯片。程序员们喜欢它，并且使客户难以转向不支持的竞争对手芯片。

Still, Nvidia’s grip on the hardware market seems secure for the next few years. Startups with no track record will struggle to convince big clients to reconfigure corporate hardware systems for their untested technology. The cloud giants’ deployment of their own chips is still limited. And Nvidia has CUDA, a software platform which allows customers to tailor chips to their needs. It is popular with programmers and makes it hard for customers to switch to rival chips, which CUDA does not support.

虽然硬件在绝对价值中赢得了增值竞赛，但是独立模型制造商在获得最大比例增益方面表现最佳。在过去16个月里，11家这样的公司的集体价值已从29亿美元增长到约138亿美元。OpenAI被认为价值1千亿美元，高于2022年10月的2千亿美元。Anthropic的估值从2022年4月的34亿美元上涨到180亿美元。成立还不到一年的法国初创公司Mistral价值20亿美元左右。其中一些价值与硬件挂钩。这些初创公司购买了大批芯片，大多数来自 **Nvidia**，用于训练模型。像OpenAI和Anthropic一样，总部位于旧金山的Imbue拥有1万个这样的半导体。加拿大竞争对手Cohere拥有1.6万个。这些芯片的价格可达几万美元。更复杂的模型需要更多的芯片。据报道，GPT-4的训练成本约为1亿美元。一些人怀疑，训练它的继任者可能需要花费OpenAI十倍的费用。

Whereas hardware wins the value-accrual race in absolute terms, it is the independent model-makers that have enjoyed the biggest proportional gains. The collective value of 11 such firms has jumped from $29bn to about $138bn in the past 16 months. OpenAI is thought to be worth $100bn, up from $20bn in October 2022. Anthropic’s valuation rose from $3.4bn in April 2022 to $18bn. Mistral, a French startup founded less than a year ago, is worth $2bn or so. Some of that value is tied up in hardware. The startups buy piles of chips, mostly from Nvidia, to train models. Imbue, which like OpenAI and Anthropic is based in San Francisco, has 10,000 such semiconductors. Cohere, a Canadian rival, has 16,000. These chips can sell for tens of thousands of dollars apiece. More sophisticated models need more chips. GPT-4 reportedly cost about $100m to train. Some suspect that training its successor could cost OpenAI ten times as much.

然而，模型制造商的真正价值在于他们的知识产权及其可能带来的利润。这些利润的程度将取决于模型提供商之间竞争的激烈程度以及它将持续多长时间。目前竞争异常激烈，这或许可以解释为什么这一层面并未获得太多美元价值。

Yet the model-makers’ true worth lies in their intellectual property and the profits it may generate. The extent of those profits will depend on just how fierce competition among model providers will get—and how long it will last. Right now the rivalry is white-hot, which may explain why the layer has not gained as much dollar value.

OpenAI占领了早期优势，但挑战者已在迎头赶上。他们能够利用与ChatGPT制造商相同的数据（即互联网上的文本和图像），而且也象ChatGPT一样，是免费的。Anthropic的Claude 3正追赶GPT-4。在GPT-4发布四个月后，Facebook母公司Meta发布了Llama 2，一款功能强大的竞争产品，与OpenAI和Anthropic的专有模型相比，它是开放的，并且可以随意调整。在2月，Mistral在不到40名员工的情况下，以一个开放模型令整个行业惊艳，这款模型几乎与GPT-4媲美，尽管训练和运行所需的计算资源要少得多。

OpenAI seized an early lead, but challengers have been catching up. They are able to tap the same data as the maker of ChatGPT (which is to say text and images on the internet) and, also like it, free of charge. Anthropic’s Claude 3 is snapping at GPT-4’s heels. Four months after the release of GPT-4, Meta, Facebook’s parent, released Llama 2, a powerful rival that, in contrast to OpenAI’s and Anthropic’s proprietary models, is open and can be tinkered with at will. In February Mistral, which has fewer than 40 staff, wowed the industry with an open model that almost rivals GPT-4, despite requiring much less computing power to train and run.

即使是较小的模型，现在也呈现出性能良好且价格低廉的趋势，风险投资公司Sequoia的Stephanie Zhan表示。一些模型专为特定任务设计。一家名为Nixtla的初创公司开发了TimeGPT，一种用于金融预测的模型。另一家名为Hippocratic AI的初创公司已经在导入医学院考试数据后进行了模型训练，以提供准确的医学建议。

Even smaller models now offer good performance at a low price, says Stephanie Zhan of Sequoia, a venture-capital (VC) firm. Some are designed for specific tasks. A startup called Nixtla developed TimeGPT, a model for financial forecasting. Another, Hippocratic AI, has trained its model on data from exams to enter medical school, to give accurate medical advice.

**模型**的丰富多样推动了应用层的增长。自2022年10月以来，我们应用组中列出的19家软件公司的价值已经上涨了1.1万亿美元，增长了35%。其中包括将生成式**人工智能**添加到其服务中的大型软件提供商。Zoom 使用它来总结视频通话。ServiceNow为公司提供技术和人力资源支持，并推出了聊天机器人来帮助解决客户的IT问题。制作Photoshop软件的Adobe推出了名为Firefly的应用程序，该应用程序利用人工智能编辑图片。新进入者正在增加更多的多样性。“There’s An AI For That”这个网站统计了超过1.2万种应用程序，比2022年的不到1,000种有所增加。DeepScribe帮助转录医生的笔记。Harvey AI 协助律师。有32个聊天机器人承诺“挑衅性对话”，还有20种生成纹身设计。但是激烈的竞争和低进入障碍意味着许多应用程序可能难以获取价值。

The abundance of models has spurred the growth of the application layer. The value of the 19 listed software firms in our application group has jumped by $1.1trn, or 35%, since October 2022. This includes big software providers that are adding generative AI to their services. Zoom uses it to summarise video calls. ServiceNow, which provides tech and human-resources support to companies, has introduced chatbots to help resolve customers’ IT queries. Adobe, maker of Photoshop, has an app called Firefly, which uses AI to edit pictures. Newcomers are adding more variety. “There’s An AI For That”, a website, counts over 12,000 applications, up from fewer than 1,000 in 2022. DeepScribe helps transcribe doctors’ notes. Harvey AI assists lawyers. Thirty-two chatbots promise “sarcastic conversation” and 20 generate tattoo designs. But fierce competition and low barriers to entry mean that many apps may struggle to capture value.

接下来是**云**层。Alphabet、亚马逊和微软的市值总额在AI繁荣期内增长了2.5万亿美元。用美元计算，这比硬件层增长的三分之一还少，以百分比计算则仅有四分之一。然而，与AI在短期内预计为大科技公司三巨头创造的实际收入相比，这一价值创造要远远超过其他层。2024年生成式**人工智能**预计将为云巨头销售额增加200亿美元，而这一价值创造是其他层的十二倍。而硬件公司的比率约为40，模型制造商大约为30。

Then there is the cloud layer. The combined market value of Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft has jumped by $2.5trn during the AI boom. Counted in dollars, that is less than three-quarters of the growth of the hardware layer, and barely a quarter in percentage terms. Yet compared with actual revenues that AI is expected to generate for the big-tech trio in the near term, this value creation far exceeds that in the other layers. It is 120 times the $20bn in revenue that generative AI is forecast to add to the cloud giants’ sales in 2024. The comparable ratio is about 40 for the hardware firms and around 30 for the model-makers.

这意味着投资者相信云巨头将是长期最大的赢家。股价与收益的比率是另一种预期未来利润的衡量标准，其指向相同的趋势。这三家云计算公司的平均比率为29，比标准普尔500家大型美国公司中的典型非科技公司高出约50%，而在2023年初为21（见图表3）。

This implies that investors believe that the cloud giants will be the biggest winners in the long run. The companies’ ratio of share price to earnings, another gauge of expected future profits, tells a similar story. The big three cloud firms average 29. That is about 50% higher than for the typical non-tech firm in the S&P 500 index of large American companies—and up from 21 in early 2023 (see chart 3).

投资者对云计算持乐观态度有三个原因。首先，这些科技巨头拥有发展世界一流AI系统的所有要素：海量数据、大量研究人员、庞大的计算能力和充足的现金储备。其次，购买AI服务的买家，如大型企业，更倾向于与已经建立起商业伙伴关系的公司打交道，而不是与未经验证的新兴公司（见图表4）。

Investors’ cloud bullishness can be explained by three factors. First, the tech titans possess all the ingredients to develop world-beating AI systems: troves of data, armies of researchers, oodles of computing power and plenty of spare cash. Second, the buyers of AI services, such as big corporations, prefer to do business with established commercial parters than with untested upstarts (see chart 4).

第三，也是最重要的是，大型科技公司有最大的潜力控制从芯片到应用的每一层。除了设计了自己的一些芯片外，亚马逊、谷歌和微软都在投资模型和应用程序。在我们的样本中的11家模型制造商中，有9家得到了至少一家巨头的支持。其中包括得到微软支持的OpenAI，得到谷歌和亚马逊支持的Anthropic以及得到微软支持的Mistral。3月19日，微软宣布聘请了Inflection AI的创始人、另一家模型制造商Mustafa Suleyman，他将领导一个新的消费者人工智能部门，并带走了Inflection的许多员工。（Suleyman先生是 *经济学人* 母公司的董事会成员。）

Third, and most important, big tech has the greatest potential to control every layer of the stack, from chips to applications. Besides designing some of their own chips, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are investing in models and apps. Of the 11 model-makers in our sample, nine have the support of at least one of the giants. That includes the Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Anthropic (Google and Amazon) and Mistral (Microsoft again). On March 19th Microsoft announced that it had hired Mustafa Suleyman, founder of Inflection AI, another model-maker, to head a new consumer-AI division—and with him many of Inflection’s staff. (Mr Suleyman sits on the board of *The Economist*’s parent company.)

控制更多层面带来利润的承诺让迄今为止专门致力于某一层面的公司开始拓展业务。OpenAI的风险投资部门自2021年1月成立以来已经投资了14家公司，包括Harvey AI 和医疗初创公司Ambience Healthcare。据称，OpenAI的老板Sam Altman正在寻求投资者资助一项耗资7万亿美元的芯片制造项目。英伟达也变得更加雄心勃勃。它在七家模型制造商中持有股份，现在还推出了自己的人工智能模型。该公司投资了Together AI 和 CoreWeave，这两家公司与其云计算客户存在竞争。在圣何塞，它发布了一款新的超级芯片和来自堆栈其他层面的工具。这场人工智能繁荣中最大的价值创造者并没有准备放弃其王冠。 ■

The promise of profits from controlling more layers is leading hitherto layer-specific firms to branch out. OpenAI’s VC arm has invested in 14 companies since its launch in January 2021, including Harvey AI and Ambience Healthcare, a medical startup. Sam Altman, boss of OpenAI, is reportedly seeking investors to bankroll a pharaonic $7trn chipmaking venture. Nvidia is becoming more ambitious, too. It has taken stakes in seven of the model-makers, and now offers its own AI models. It has invested in Together AI and CoreWeave, both of which compete with its big cloud customers. In San Jose it unveiled a new superchip and tools from other layers of the stack. The AI boom’s biggest single value-creator is in no mood to cede its crown. ■

事业成功的秘诀很可能在一旁 (The secret to career success may well be off to the side)
=====================================================================

效仿螃蟹的理由 (The case for being more like a crab)
------------------------------------------

![插图展示了一个螃蟹般的形象，拥有人类的躯干和螃蟹般的腿。这个生物被描绘为在表面横向移动，箭头指示它向上攀升。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_WBD003.jpg)

**传统的事业成功语言只朝一个方向发展：向上。你攀登事业阶梯或者爬上油滑的柱子。如果表现出色，你将快速攀升。而如果真的成功了，你会登上巅峰。没有人会打电话回家分享他们达到了一个平台的消息。但还有另一种事业发展路径。横向跳槽，去做不涉及晋升甚至不一定有加薪的工作，对雇员和组织都有好处。**

The conventional language of career success moves in only one direction: up. You scale the career ladder or climb the greasy pole. If you do well, you have a rapid ascent. And if you really succeed, you reach the top. No one ever rings home to share the news that they have reached a plateau. But there is another type of career trajectory. Sideways moves, to jobs that don’t involve a promotion or even necessarily a pay rise, can be a boon to employees and organisations alike.

2021年，麻省理工学院的唐纳德·苏尔及其合著者进行的一项研究发现，横向职业机会的可用性对员工保留率产生了显著影响。他们的研究发现，与薪酬相比，横向转岗的机会是员工愿意留在公司的预测因素之一两倍半重要。另一份论文，由南佛罗里达大学的辛晋和康奈尔大学的迈克尔·沃尔德曼撰写，得出结论：横向转岗不仅对组织有益，经历此类转岗的员工更有可能获得晋升，并在日后的职业生涯中享受更高的工资增长，而未经历此类转岗的员工则不然。你可以通过先横向移动来向上晋升。

A study carried out by Donald Sull of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his co-authors in 2021 found that the availability of lateral career opportunities has a marked impact on employee retention. Their research found that chances to move sideways were two and a half times more important than pay as a predictor of workers’ willingness to stay at a firm. Another paper, by Xin Jin of the University of South Florida and Michael Waldman of Cornell University, concluded that lateral moves did not just benefit organisations: employees who experienced them were more likely to be promoted and to enjoy higher wage growth later in their careers than employees who did not. You can move up by first moving sideways.

横向转岗和良好的管理似乎是相辅相成的。英国智囊团体财政研究所的弗吉尼亚·米尼最近发表的一篇论文，研究了在一家跨国公司内十年间的职位变动。她发现，一名早期职业就已获得高薪职位的高飞老板的到来，与员工之间发生的公司内部调动（包括水平和垂直方向）出现了增加。更优秀的老板似乎擅长将人才分配到适合他们的角色中。这一过程再次为横向转岗的员工带来了日后更高的薪酬；这也与更高的利润相关。

Lateral moves and good management seem to go hand in hand. A recent paper by Virginia Minni of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a British think-tank, looked at job moves within a big multinational over a period of ten years. She found that the arrival of a high-flying boss (who had got the job early in their career) was associated with a jump in intra-company transfers, both horizontal and vertical, among employees. Better bosses seem to be good at sorting people into roles that suit them. This process again results in higher pay over time for employees who move sideways; it is also associated with higher profits.

螃蟹式事业还有其他优点，超越于人与工作之间更合适的匹配。其中之一是它是学习新知识的好方式。随着招聘流程日益强调技能，招聘人员可能会相对较少地侧重简历内容，而更看重技能掌握的程度。辛晋和迈克尔·沃尔德曼推断，公司的高层管理往往由能力广泛而非深度的人组成；这也许可以解释为什么横向转岗对晋升前景有益。技能与人脉并存：团队之间的转岗通常会扩大内部人际网络。

The crab-like career has other things going for it beyond better matches between people and jobs. One is that it is a good way to learn new things. As hiring processes increasingly emphasise skills, recruiters are likely to put comparatively less emphasis on CVs and comparatively more weight on what you know. Messrs Jin and Waldman reason that the higher echelons of companies tend to be populated by people whose capabilities are broad, not deep; that may explain why lateral moves are good for promotion prospects. Along with skills come contacts: transferring between teams usually means building a bigger internal network.

横向转岗还可以很好地摆脱无聊。有点无聊并不可怕，但人们会竭尽所能避免大剂量的无聊。在马斯特里赫特大学的尚塔尔·内德尔库恩及其合著者进行的一项实验中，参与者被要求观看乏味、悲伤和中性的电影片段，并在此过程中有自行施加电击的能力。观看乏味影片的人更频繁且更剧烈地给自己电击。（可以推测，韦斯·安德森的电影因此被认为太危险而不能展示。）

Lateral moves can also be a wonderful cure for boredom. There is nothing to fear in a bit of tedium, but people will do almost anything to avoid it in large doses. In an experiment by Chantal Nederkoorn of Maastricht University and her co-authors, participants were asked to watch dull, sad and neutral film clips and given the ability to self-administer electric shocks as they did so. Those watching monotonous films shocked themselves more often and at greater intensity. (Films by Wes Anderson were presumably too dangerous to be shown for this reason.)

对工作场所的需要刺激普遍存在。调查结果不断显示，很多员工认为他们的工作令人厌倦。哥伦比亚商学院的斯蒂芬·迈尔，他正在撰写关于以员工为中心的组织的书，认为员工动力的一个重要来源是拥有"刚刚好的任务"，这些任务在他们的能力范围内，但又以新方式挑战他们。晋升提供了新的挑战，但你也很容易陷入等待在你之上的职位出现的僵局中。向侧面看可以提供更多选择。

This need for stimulation pervades the workplace. Surveys consistently show that great chunks of the workforce find their jobs tedious. Stephan Meier of Columbia Business School, who is writing a book on employee-centric organisations, reckons that one big source of motivation for workers is having “just right tasks” that are within their capabilities but stretch them in new ways. Promotions offer fresh challenges but you can also easily get stuck waiting for a vacancy to open up above you. Looking to the side affords more options.

Opening the door to more lateral moves is partly a practical matter. Some bigger employers have “internal talent marketplaces” in which employees can find and apply for jobs elsewhere in the company; smaller firms have fewer such opportunities to offer. But participating in a side-project is another way for workers to shake things up and learn new skills. In a poll of American workers for Colorado State University Global, almost half said that they would feel more motivated if they were part of a new process or project.

Embracing sideways movement also requires the right attitude. Lots of managers like to hoard talent, at the expense of workers and firms. And moving horizontally still has less cachet than moving upwards. It would help if career success had a different vocabulary: across or out, say, or the meteoric scuttle.■

资本主义的急诊医生需求飙升 (Demand is soaring for capitalism’s emergency surgeons)
==================================================================

随着企业违约数量上升，进行重组咨询的顾问们赚得盆满钵满。 (As corporate defaults rise, advisers on restructuring are raking it in)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![ 在破产商店展示待售商品。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_WBP503.jpg)

随着股市不断飙升和全球经济出人意料地强劲，许多评论者开始后悔之前对企业和投资者未来艰难时期的悲观警告。他们或许在对经济的预测上错了。但在一方面他们的悲观表现却是完全正确的。去年，由信用评级机构穆迪公司评定的159家公司违约，比前一年（不包括俄罗斯公司）的92家有所增加。自1980年以来，这一数字仅在2001年、2009年和2020年超过过（详见图表）。在美国，去年的违约数量几乎是2022年的三倍，而企业却没有面临互联网泡沫破裂、金融危机或大流行病。

With stockmarkets on a tear and the global economy surprisingly buoyant, plenty of pundits are regretting gloomy warnings of tough times ahead for businesses and investors. They may have been wrong about the economy. But in one respect their gloom looks spot on. Last year 159 companies covered by Moody’s, a ratings agency, defaulted on their debts, up from 92 the year before (excluding Russian firms). Since 1980 that figure has been exceeded only in 2001, 2009 and 2020 (see chart). In America the number of defaults almost tripled last year, compared with 2022—and businesses faced no dotcom crash, financial crisis or pandemic.

从厨房小工具制造商Instant Brands到卡车公司Yellow，曾经强劲的公司都在销售下滑和利率上升的压力下倒下。而情况正在恶化：据穆迪公司统计，今年头两个月，全球有23家公司违约，比去年同期的19家有所增加。据报道，亏损严重的廉价航空公司Spirit Airlines的债权人在一月份因被法院以反垄断为由否决与竞争对手JetBlue Airways合并的提议后，正在权衡应对措施。 3月18日，拥有大约850家手工店的连锁店Joann申请破产。

Once-robust companies from Instant Brands, a maker of kitchen gadgets, to Yellow, a trucking firm, have collapsed under the weight of falling sales and rising interest rates. And the situation is getting worse: in the first two months of the year 23 firms around the world defaulted on their debts, according to Moody’s, up from 19 in the same period last year. Creditors of Spirit Airlines, a budget carrier that is bleeding cash, are reportedly weighing their options after a proposed tie-up with JetBlue Airways, a rival, was quashed by a court on antitrust grounds in January. On March 18th Joann, a chain of some 850 craft stores, filed for bankruptcy.

除了得到证实的悲观主义者，还有一些默默感到满意的人—那些专门从事重组资不抵债企业的顾问也在其中。当一家公司濒临倒闭时，投资银行会被委托与股东和债权人谈判，必要时还会帮助出售资产。顾问们被拉来削减成本和重新制定商业计划。律师们研究文件。对这些人来说，2023年是有记录以来最繁忙的一年之一—而2024年也有望一样利润丰厚。

The vindicated gloomsters are not the only ones quietly pleased by the rising number of corporate failures. So too are the advisers who specialise in restructuring distressed businesses. When a company is on the edge of a precipice, investment bankers are enlisted to negotiate with shareholders and creditors as well as, if needed, to help sell off assets. Consultants are drafted in to slash costs and rewrite business plans. Lawyers pore over the paperwork. For this lot, 2023 was one of the busiest years on record—and 2024 is shaping up to be equally lucrative.

大部分顾问业务都由华尔街的大力量和知名顾问们分享。但重组工作不是这样的。那些向投资者兜售贷款的大型投资银行，如高盛和摩根斯坦利，很尴尬地难以请求债务人方面的宽限。作为“四大”专业服务巨头—德勤、安永、毕马威和普华永道—在审计工作中已被卷入冲突之中。麦肯锡，一家战略咨询公司，其咨询建议备受推崇（尤其是对其自家咨询师），曾试图但未能成功加入—去年该公司解散了其破产业务。

Most advisory business is carved up between Wall Street powerhouses and big-name consultants. But not restructuring work. Having hawked loans to investors, large investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley find it awkward to then plead for leniency on behalf of borrowers. The “big four” professional-services giants—Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC—are tied up in conflicts from their auditing work. McKinsey, a strategy consultancy whose advice is held in high regard (especially by its own consultants), has tried but failed to cut in—last year the firm wound down its bankruptcy practice.

相反，面临破产的企业会聘请如豪利汉·洛基和PJT Partners等精品银行，以及像AlixPartners和阿尔瓦雷兹与马萨尔等专业重组顾问。 （在重组市场上，柯克兰和埃利斯、莱瑟姆和华金如等律师事务所则是例外。）他们的费用可能令人瞠目结舌。化妆品制造商露华浓去年在经历了十个月的破产后，向顾问支付了大约2.5亿美元。据数据提供商Reorg称，2023年美国法院批准了破产公司支付的21亿美元，相当于这些倒闭公司债务的1.5%，而上年这一数字为17亿美元。

Instead businesses facing bankruptcy enlist boutique banks, such as Houlihan Lokey and PJT Partners, and specialist restructuring consultants, like AlixPartners and Alvarez & Marsal. (Law firms are the exception, with top dogs such as Kirkland & Ellis and Latham & Watkins also triumphing in the restructuring market.) Their fees can be eye-watering. Revlon, a maker of cosmetics that emerged from a ten-month bankruptcy last May, shelled out some $250m to advisers during the process. According to Reorg, a data provider, American courts signed off $2.1bn of such payments by bankrupt companies in 2023, equivalent to 1.5% of the failed firms’ debts, up from $1.7bn the year before.

这还远远低估了待拿走的工作量，因为重组工作通常在公司最终进入法院之前就开始了。Moelis & Company的William Derrough表示：“我们从来没遇到过一个急于破产的管理团队。”实际上，顾问在一定程度上因为大多数高管在重组方面经验有限才受邀参与，AlixPartners的Joff Mitchell指出。

Even that vastly understates the amount of work up for grabs, given that restructuring efforts typically begin well before a company ends up in court. “We’ve never met a management team that can’t wait to go into bankruptcy,” says William Derrough of Moelis & Company, another investment bank that advises on restructurings. Indeed, advisers are called upon in part because most executives have limited experience with restructurings, notes Joff Mitchell of AlixPartners.

宾夕法尼亚大学沃顿商学院的Kevin Kaiser表示，管理这些过程变得更加棘手，因为资本结构变得更加复杂，参与的各方范围也扩大了。私募股权所有者和一群各种信用投资者，包括一些专门购买廉价债务的投资者，现在在激烈的谈判中针锋相对。Houlihan Lokey的Joseph Swanson表示：“毫无疑问，不是每个人都同意应该给予谁什么。”

Managing such processes has become trickier as capital structures have grown more elaborate and the range of parties involved has expanded, says Kevin Kaiser of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Private-equity owners and a motley crew of credit investors, including some who specialise in buying dicey debts on the cheap, now go head-to-head in fiery negotiations. “Unsurprisingly, not everyone agrees on who should get what,” says Joseph Swanson of Houlihan Lokey.

近年来，在这些谈判中的力量平衡已向债务人转移。Rothschild & Co的Andrew Merrett表示，公司能够发行的债务不仅廉价，而且附带的条款更少。他表示：“诸如强制借款人维持最低利润与债务比率等约束条件，在2007-09年全球金融危机之前很常见，现在已变得罕见。”

In recent years the balance of power in those negotiations has shifted towards the borrowers. Companies were able to issue debt that was not just inexpensive, but also came with fewer strings attached, notes Andrew Merrett of Rothschild & Co, one more investment bank with a busy restructuring practice. “Covenants” that, for example, forced borrowers to maintain a minimum ratio of profits to debts on pain of having their business seized by creditors, common before the global financial crisis of 2007-09, have become rare.

这给了借款人巧妙的变通余地。在一种称为“转移”的流行举措中，公司将有价值的资产转移到一个新的子公司，使债权人无法触及，并通过这些资产再发行债务，利用所得款项增加现金储备，甚至以折扣价格回购旧债。在2022年，健康护理公司Envision，当时由私募股权巨头KKR持有，就完成了这样的操作。经营同日手术中心的业务单位AMSURG被剥离出来，并被用作新贷款的抵押，引发了Envision现有债权人的愤怒。一位资深破产律师表示，这种“债权人对债权人的暴力”现象变得越来越普遍。

That has left borrowers room for clever workarounds. In one popular move, known as a “drop-down”, a company shifts valuable assets into a new subsidiary beyond the reach of creditors, and then issues fresh debt against those assets, using the proceeds to top up cash reserves or even repurchase old debts at a discount. In 2022 Envision, a health-care company then owned by KKR, a private-equity giant, pulled off such a manoeuvre. AMSURG, a business unit managing same-day surgery centres, was hived off and used as collateral for a new loan, enraging Envision’s existing creditors. Such “lender-on-lender violence” is becoming more common, says a veteran restructuring lawyer.

这类方案可以为借款人购买时间—但并非永久。去年五月，Envision最终陷入破产，KKR失去了35亿美元的股权投资。这家公司在清偿了70亿美元的债务后，于十月份以两家独立的组织形式重组：经营同日手术中心的AMSURG业务被从提供医生给医院的主要业务单位中剥离。

Schemes like these can buy a borrower time—but not indefinitely. In May last year Envision finally collapsed into bankruptcy, and KKR lost its $3.5bn equity investment. After shedding $7bn of debt, the company emerged from the process in October as two separate organisations: AMSURG was amputated from its other main business unit, which provides doctors to hospitals.

由于央行仍对通货膨胀保持警惕，并不愿降低利率，更多的股东可能很快被迫认输。最终，所有沉迷于廉价债务的公司都将不得不进行再融资，几乎肯定会以更高的利率。这表明还有更多的重组工作即将到来。正如PJT Partners的Steve Zelin总结的：“我们看到了漫长且稳定的机会期。” ■

With central banks still leery of inflation and reluctant to lower interest rates, more shareholders may soon be forced to throw in the towel. Eventually, all companies that gorged on cheap debt will have to refinance, almost certainly at higher rates. That suggests many more restructurings to come. As Steve Zelin of PJT Partners sums up, “We see a long and steady period of opportunity ahead.” ■

豪华酒店正经历辉煌时刻 (Luxury hotels are having a glorious moment)
=====================================================

富有的旅行者意味着投资者丰厚的回报 (Rich travellers mean rich returns for investors)
----------------------------------------------------------------

![新加坡莱佛士酒店的大堂。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_WBP002.jpg)

在英格兰北部的唐卡斯特，**100,000**美元可以买到一栋有四个卧室的房子。而在迪拜，这笔钱只够你住一晚上四个卧室的阁楼公寓。皇家大宅（Royal Mansion）位于亚特兰蒂斯哈皇家酒店（Atlantis The Royal）的第18和19楼，其夜间房价是世界上最昂贵的套房，这里拥有**1100**平方米（**12,000**平方英尺）的大理石地板、带有无边泳池的露台、蒸汽房、爱马仕洗发水、**500**美元的浴袍、一个颇具规模的迷你吧台，当然少不了一个管家。

IN DONCASTER, A town in northern England, $100,000 will buy you a four-bedroom house. In Dubai, it will get you a four-bedroom penthouse—for a night. The Royal Mansion, the nightly rate for which makes it the world’s priciest suite, sits on the 18th and 19th floors of the Atlantis The Royal hotel. It comes with 1,100 square metres (12,000 square feet) of marble floors, a terrace with an infinity pool, a steam room, Hermès shampoo, $500 bathrobes, a not-so-mini bar and, naturally, a butler.

皇家大宅的奢华和价格难以匹敌。但从博茨瓦纳的奥卡万戈三角洲到澳大利亚南部的袋鼠岛，越来越多略逊一筹的奢华物业在涌现。沙特阿拉伯正在红海沿岸建设生态度假胜地，共拥有**8000**间客房，一位高管称之为“新马尔代夫”。伦敦的BT塔正在改建为高端酒店。对于有钱人来说，所有这些都不可能进展得快。

The Royal Mansion’s opulence—and price—are hard to rival. But only a bit less posh properties are popping up from the Okavango Delta in Botswana to Kangaroo Island in southern Australia. Saudi Arabia is building eco-resorts on the Red Sea with a collective 8,000 rooms, which one executive calls the “new Maldives”. London’s BT Tower is being converted into a high-end hotel. For well-heeled globetrotters, all these cannot come up fast enough.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_WBC883.png)

与中档酒店相比，豪华酒店正处于蓬勃发展之中。什么样的酒店算是豪华有各种不同的定义，但你一看就知道。分析公司Grand View Research预计，今年旅行者将在所谓的豪华旅行上花费**1.5万亿**美元，几乎回到了疫情前的水平。到**2030**年，这个数字可能会增加到**2.3万亿**美元（见图表1）。其中很大一部分将用于住宿，而且越奢华越好。根据分析公司CoStar的估计，去年可用的豪华客房数量可能会达到**190**万间，比去年的**160**万间增加，但酒店经营者们仍然难以满足需求。

In contrast to mid-range hotels, luxury ones are in the midst of a boom. The precise definition of what counts as luxury varies, but you know it when you see it. Grand View Research, a firm of analysts, expects travellers to splurge $1.5trn on what it calls luxury trips this year, nearly back to pre-pandemic levels. By 2030 they may be pampering themselves to the tune of $2.3trn (see chart 1). A big slug of that will go on accommodation—the fancier, the better. The number of available luxury rooms could reach 1.9m, up from 1.6m last year, reckons CoStar, an analytics firm (see chart 2). Even so, hoteliers are having trouble keeping up with demand.

原因之一是越来越多的富豪，而且他们越来越富有。根据瑞银（UBS）的数据，**2012**年全球有**2900**万美元百万富翁，到**2022**年，这个数字超过了**6000**万。这些银汉们的总财富超过了**200**万亿美元。现在有更多来自原本是中等收入甚至贫穷地区的富豪。据预测，巴西的百万富翁数量到**2027**年将近翻倍，达到将近**80**万人。到**2028**年，印度预计将再培养出**7000**名净资产达到**3000**万美元或更多的人士，而去年这个数字为**13000**人。

One reason is that there are more big spenders, and they are getting richer. In 2012 the world had 29m dollar millionaires, according to UBS, a bank. By 2022 that figure more than doubled to nearly 60m. The collective fortune of these silver-spooned individuals exceeded $200trn. Many more now hail from what are otherwise middle-income or even poor places. The number of millionaires in Brazil is forecast nearly to double by 2027, to almost 800,000. By 2028 India is expected to mint another 7,000 people with a net worth of $30m or more, on top of the 13,000 it had last year.

超级富豪并不是唯一参与昂贵旅行的人。普通富裕阶层也越来越在耗费更多可支配收入享受独特的体验。企业商务旅行者在商务出差之外增加了几天休闲行程。老板们在奢华的度假胜地上挥金如土，以提升混合办公团队的团队精神；在美国，**1**月份预订十间或更多豪华客房的数量同比增长了**9%**。

The filthy rich are not the only ones partaking in pricey peregrinations. The merely well-to-do are increasingly forking out more of their disposable income on exclusive experiences. Corporate road-warriors are tacking a few days of leisure on top of business jaunts. Bosses are splurging on plush retreats as a way to boost esprit de corps in a hybridised workforce; in America bookings of ten or more luxury rooms rose by 9% in January, year on year.

所有这些追求辉煌的人都在争夺稀缺的客房。尽管在疫情暂停后新酒店的建设已经恢复，但进展缓慢，尤其是历史城市中心和自然保护区等特定地点的奢华住所。在许多地区，仅仅是获得必要的批准和许可就可能需要**5**至**7**年的时间。在码头下工程之前还要执行。亚特兰蒂斯哈皇家酒店耗时**14**年才从头到尾完成建设。一些品牌明确限制供应以制造稀缺性。意大利珠宝商宝格丽（Bulgari）与美国酒店集团万豪国际（Marriott International）的合资企业宝格丽酒店将限制自己开设**15**家酒店。

All these splendour-seekers are competing for scarce rooms. Although construction of new hotels has resumed after a pandemic-induced pause, it is slow going, especially for fancy digs in select locations such as historic city centres and nature reserves. In many parts of the world just acquiring the necessary approvals and permits can take between five and seven years. And that is before any cement is poured. Atlantis The Royal took 14 years to build from start to finish. Some brands are explicitly constraining supply to create scarcity. Bulgari Hotels, a joint venture between the eponymous Italian jeweller and Marriott International, an American hotelier, will limit itself to 15 locations.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_WBC871.png)

供需不平衡使得酒店经营者能够将每晚房价提高至远超通货膨胀水平，而不必过多担心赶走客人。**2023**年，法国持有象拔蚌和莱佛士等高档酒店的雅高集团的收入增长了**20%**，达到**50亿**欧元（**54**亿美元）。其总毛利润增加了一半，达到**10**亿欧元。英国竞争对手英特科洲际酒店集团，豪华客房的每间可用收入增长速度是其较不奢华住所的两倍。

The imbalance between supply and demand is allowing hoteliers to raise nightly rates well above inflation, without worrying too much about putting off patrons. In 2023 revenues at Accor, the French owner of swanky chains like Fairmont and Raffles, rose by 20%, to €5bn ($5.4bn). Its gross operating profit swelled by half, to €1bn. At InterContinental Hotels Group, a British rival, revenues per available luxury room rose twice as fast as those for its less plush accommodations.

这正在将豪华酒店转变为一种赚钱的资产类别。**2022**年，这类酒店的年回报率超过了**6%**，是至少十年来最高的（见图表3）。这反过来又吸引了除了传统的酒店经营者、房地产开发商和收购男爵之外的投资者。总部位于加利福尼亚州的Montage International拥有包括巴哈马的蒙塔吉凯在内的十几家豪华酒店，其支持者中包括黑石和高盛等华尔街的支柱。瑞士的阿曼集团已经获得了**10**亿美元以上的投资，其中包括来自波斯湾的主权财富基金。管理沙特阿拉伯财富的公共投资基金最近斥资**18**亿美元，收购了英国公司Rocco Forte**49%**的股权，后者拥有位于梅费尔的**Brown's Hotel**和罗马的**Hotel de Russie**。对奢侈享受永远不够只是那些备足钱财的旅行者。■

This is turning luxury hotels into a lucrative asset class. The annual rate of return on such properties exceeded 6% in 2022, the highest in at least a decade (see chart 3). And that in turn is attracting investors beyond the usual hotel operators, property developers and buy-out barons. Montage International, a Californian owner of a dozen lavish properties such as Montage Cay in the Bahamas, counts Wall Street stalwarts like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs among its backers. The Aman Group of Switzerland has received more than $1bn from investors that include sovereign-wealth funds from the Persian Gulf. The Public Investment Fund, which manages Saudi Arabia’s riches, recently paid $1.8bn for a 49% stake in Rocco Forte, a British firm that owns Brown’s Hotel in Mayfair and Hotel de Russie in Rome. It isn’t just deep-pocketed travellers who can’t get enough luxury. ■

阿尔迪超市能征服美国吗？ (Could Aldi’s supermarkets conquer America?)
======================================================

这家欧洲折扣连锁店是横跨大西洋增长最快的零售商 (The European discount chain is the fastest-growing retailer across the Atlantic)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![纽约约克维尔的阿尔迪杂货店](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_WBP501.jpg)

德国人在购物食物时以吝啬著称。难怪在20世纪50年代，两位德国兄弟蒂奥和卡尔·阿尔布莱希特创立了全球第一家**折扣**食品店——阿尔迪。1961年，他们在欧洲市场上划分了势力范围，蒂奥领导的阿尔迪北和卡尔领导的阿尔迪南。但尽管是先驱者，这两家**阿尔迪**在欧洲市场上正被**里德尔**挤占市场份额，后者是一家销量在欧洲大陆超过两家**阿尔迪**总和的年轻竞争对手。

Germans are famously stingy when shopping for food. No wonder that it was two German brothers, Theo and Karl Albrecht, who in the 1950s founded Aldi, the world’s first discount grocer. In 1961 they carved up the European market between Aldi Nord, led by Theo, and Aldi Süd, headed by Karl. But despite pioneering the business model, the two Aldis are having their lunch eaten in Europe by Lidl, a younger rival whose sales on the continent exceed their combined total.

尤其是**阿尔迪南**认为，在大西洋彼岸可以将自己发挥到极致。根据物业咨询公司**jLL**的数据，**阿尔迪南**在美国每年开设约100家店铺，比任何其他零售商都快，包括**里德尔**和**阿尔迪北**（后者拥有**Trader Joe's**超市，但在那里不经营**阿尔迪**店铺）。

Aldi Süd, in particular, thinks it can get its own back across the Atlantic. According to jLL, a property consultancy, it has been opening around 100 shops a year in America, faster than any other retailer—including Lidl and Aldi Nord (which owns Trader Joe’s supermarkets but does not run Aldi shops there).

去年，**阿尔迪南**宣布收购了阿拉巴马州、佛罗里达州、乔治亚州、路易斯安那州和密西西比州约400家温迪克西和哈维斯超市。其中许多将被改建为**阿尔迪**市场。而本月初，领导**阿尔迪南**美国业务的杰森·哈特承诺加快步伐。他表示，公司将在未来五年投资90亿美元，开设800家新的**阿尔迪**（包括温迪克西和哈维斯的改建），此外还将增加到已拥有的2400家店铺。

Last year Aldi Süd announced the takeover of around 400 Winn-Dixie and Harveys supermarkets in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi. Many of them will be remodelled as Aldi markets. And earlier this month Jason Hart, who heads Aldi Süd’s American business, promised to pick up the pace. He said the company will invest $9bn over five years to open 800 new Aldis (including the Winn-Dixie and Harvey conversions), on top of the 2,400 it already has.

哈特先生成功的部分原因在于幸运。在美国，**阿尔迪**的极低价格吸引了因食品价格上涨而感到不满的美国人。尽管食品价格不再飞涨，但与四年前相比，如今的食品价格高出23%。总统乔·拜登在连任竞选中抨击较小的士力架巧克力和包装袋中薯片的减少。

Mr Hart has succeeded where most rivals have struggled partly thanks to luck. Aldi’s rock-bottom prices appeal to Americans irked by food inflation. Although food prices are no longer rocketing, they are 23% higher today than they were four years ago. President Joe Biden rails against punier Snickers bars and fewer crisps per packet in his re-election campaign.

另一次好运是联邦贸易委员会的反垄断调查，他们挑战了按销售额计算为第二大超市连锁店的阿尔伯森斯被最大连锁店克罗格（沃尔玛更大，但在监管者看来，它不是超市而是零售商）收购的250亿美元交易。这笔交易将创造一个高效的对手，能够与供应商进行激烈的讨价还价。

Another piece of good fortune was the decision by trustbusters at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to challenge the $25bn takeover of Albertsons, the second-largest supermarket chain by sales, by Kroger, the largest. (Walmart is bigger but in the eyes of regulators it is not a supermarket but a retailer.) That deal would create an efficient rival capable of driving a hard bargain with suppliers.

尽管如此，运气并非一切。其他折扣店，包括里德尔，没有像**阿尔迪南**那样增长迅速。哈特先生通过专注于简陋但精明管理的基本要素取得了成功。**阿尔迪**比竞争对手提供的选择要少得多：平均每家店提供1600种产品，而典型的美国超市提供31000种，而已经很节约的**Trader Joe's**则有4000种。这使它可以保持店铺规模较小，从而降低物业和公用事业费用。约90%的产品是自有品牌，因此它更多地保留了利润。它没有生肉、奶酪或面包柜台，并且将产品陈列在用于运输的纸箱中，所有这些让它可以少雇用一些人为顾客提供服务和摆放货物。它支付其经理高薪，但并不给予有损盈利的奖金。

Still, luck isn’t everything. Other discounters, including Lidl, have not grown nearly as fast as Aldi Süd. Mr Hart has pulled it off by focusing on bare but astutely managed essentials. Aldis offer far fewer choices than rival outlets: 1,600 products, on average, compared with 31,000 for a typical American supermarket and 4,000 for the already spare Trader Joe’s. That lets it keep shops small, bringing down property and utility costs. Around 90% of its products are its own brand, so it keeps more of the margin for itself. It has no fresh-meat, cheese or bakery counters, and displays products in the cardboard boxes used for delivery, all of which lets it employ fewer people to serve shoppers and stock shelves. It pays its managers good salaries but no bottom-line-hurting bonuses.

如果哈特先生如愿以偿，而且联邦贸易委员会在法院针对克罗格和阿尔伯森斯的案件中取得胜利，五年后**阿尔迪南**将拥有在美国的店铺比除了沃尔玛（如今拥有4700家店铺）以外的任何零售商都要多。尽管在文件上，本顿维尔的巨兽可能属于一个不同的类别，但这并不能阻止**阿尔迪**试图对其业务进行侵蚀。 ■

If Mr Hart has his way, and if the FTC prevails in court against Kroger and Albertsons, in five years Aldi Süd will have more shops in America than any retailer save Walmart (which today boasts 4,700). The beast of Bentonville may be in a different category on paper, but that may not stop Aldi from trying to take a bite out of its business. ■



<hr><span style="color: red;"><b>商业 | 中国的其他TikTok</b></span> (Business | China’s other TikToks)

TikTok并非唯一在美国蓬勃发展的中国应用 (TikTok is not the only Chinese app thriving in America)
============================================================================

如果这个短视频狂潮被禁止，它们会怎样？ (What happens to them if the short-video sensation is banned?)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![在纽约时代广场为直播公司 Bigo Live 所做的广告。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_WBP502.jpg)

**随着** TikTok 遭到禁令的可能性，其拥有1.7亿美国用户可能开始寻找替代消磨时间的选择。他们可以选择 Bigo Live，这是一款受欢迎的类似 TikTok 的直播应用。或者选择 Likee，它提供类似的视频编辑和分享选项，在全球拥有超过1亿用户。还有 Hago，它将社交媒体和视频游戏融合在一起，已经拥有大约5亿次下载量。

WITH THE prospect of a ban hanging over TikTok, its 170m American users may start looking for an alternative time-sink. They could plump for Bigo Live, popular for TikTokish live-streaming. Or Likee, which offers similar video-editing and sharing options and has more than 100m users around the world. There is also Hago, which blends social media and video games, and which has clocked up some 500m downloads.

这三款应用在另一个方面与 TikTok 相似。制造它们的公司 Joyy 总部位于新加坡，就像 TikTok 一样。而且与 TikTok 的母公司字节跳动一样，Joyy 的控股股东称为**Huanju**，总部设在中国大陆。

The three apps are similar to TikTok in another way, too. The firm that makes them, Joyy, is based in Singapore, just like TikTok. And like ByteDance, TikTok’s parent firm, Joyy’s controlling shareholder, called Huanju, is based in mainland China.

字节跳动和**Huanju** 是数十家在西方互联网上蓬勃发展的中国公司之一，远离中国的审查。它们开发出各种应用，涵盖从游戏和社交媒体到健身和照片编辑的各个领域。许多公司在中国以外设立了总部，通常在新加坡，并没有宣传它们的中国背景。许多公司坚决否认自己是中国公司。

ByteDance and Huanju are among dozens of Chinese firms that are thriving on the free-wheeling Western internet, away from China’s censors. They develop apps for everything from gaming and social media to fitness and photo-editing. Many have set up headquarters outside China, often in Singapore, and do not advertise their Chineseness. Plenty dispute the notion that they are Chinese at all.

据研究机构 Sensor Tower 称，去年，名为米哈游的上海视频游戏公司在海外视频游戏收入方面表现超过了中国游戏巨头腾讯（未上市的米哈游没有披露具体数据）。全球前30大中国视频游戏开发商在中国以外市场占据了18%的销售额。中国相关的电商应用也取得了类似的成功。Shein 是一家主要向美国客户销售廉价服装的电商平台，去年销售额估计为数十亿美元。波导, 总部位于波士顿但由中国电商巨头拼多多所拥有，可能实现了几十亿美元的销售额。拼多多在纽约上市，未公布波导的业绩，但于2023年第四季度报告显示，其整体销售额增长超过一倍，达到125亿美元。

According to Sensor Tower, a research firm, a Shanghainese video-gaming firm called MiHoYo last year outperformed even Tencent, a Chinese games powerhouse, when it came to foreign revenues from video games (unlisted MiHoYo does not disclose figures). The 30 biggest Chinese video-game makers account for 18% of the industry’s global sales outside China. Chinese-linked e-commerce apps have been similarly successful. Shein, which sells cheap clothing, mainly to Americans, is thought to have sold garments worth tens of billions of dollars last year. Temu, which is based in Boston but owned by a giant Chinese e-merchant, PDD, may have notched up several billion dollars. PDD, which is listed in New York, does not break out Temu’s results, but on March 20th it reported that its overall sales more than doubled in the last quarter of 2023, to $12.5bn.

其他中国服务也在向美国市场拓展。Daily Yoga，一款受运动爱好者欢迎的应用，由中国西安公司所有。Bestie-Portrait，一款照片编辑软件，也有中国背景。CapCut，全球最受欢迎的视频编辑应用之一，归字节跳动所有。Lemon8，与 Instagram 类似的照片和视频分享应用，也属于字节跳动。ReelShort，向美国观众提供微剧集的肥皂剧应用，是 Crazy Maple Studios 全资拥有的，其母公司 COL 数字出版总部位于北京。

Other Chinese services are also pushing into America. Daily Yoga, an app popular with exercise aficionados, is owned by a company from the Chinese city of Xi’an. Bestie-Portrait, a photo-editor, has Chinese owners. CapCut, one of the world’s most popular video-editing apps, is owned by ByteDance. So is Lemon8, a photo- and video-sharing app similar to Instagram. ReelShort, which serves up soap operas to American viewers in micro-episodes, is owned by Crazy Maple Studios, a Californian subsidiary of COL Digital Publishing, whose headquarters are in Beijing.

对于 TikTok 的禁令可能会导致这些应用被束之高阁。他们可能会被指责与中国当局分享用户数据，成为宣传工具，或两者兼有。TikTok 否认这些指控，指出了其为隔离美国数据和算法所做的努力，并表示中共对其没有影响力。其他具有中国背景的应用可能很快也要开始发表类似的否认声明。■

A ban on TikTok could open the door to many of these apps being consigned to the digital dustbin. They risk being accused, as TikTok has been, of sharing users’ data with Chinese authorities, being a vehicle for propaganda, or both. TikTok denies these allegations, points to its efforts to ring-fence its American data and algorithm, and says that the Communist Party holds no sway over it. Other apps with Chinese roots may soon have to start issuing similar denials. ■

有什么能阻止英伟达的黄仁勋？ (Can anything stop Nvidia’s Jensen Huang?)
======================================================

他已经成为我们这个时代的生成式AI表演者。 (He has become the generative-AI showman of our time)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

![插图：被描绘成“亨德里克斯”的Jensen Huang，手持一块巨大的电脑芯片，而不是吉他。芯片上发出迷幻符号，将他围绕在色彩斑斓的颜色和图案中。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_WBD000.jpg)

Jensen Huang正在追求使命，但这并不妨碍他抽出时间以自嘲的方式讲述自己的故事。去年春天，当他的半导体公司——Nvidia——正朝着成为生成人工智能（**AI**）宠儿的道路走去时，他和妻子在湾区买了一栋新房。购房完成前，Huang先生非常忙碌，以至于没能抽出时间去看看房子。他后来承认，这令他非常遗憾，因为周围种植的植物令他患上了花粉热。

Jensen Huang is a man on a mission—but not so much that he does not have time to tell a good story at his own expense. Last spring, when his semiconductor company, Nvidia, was well on its way to becoming a darling of generative artificial intelligence (AI), he and his wife bought a new home in the Bay Area. Mr Huang was so busy he could not spare much time to visit it before the purchase was completed. Pity, he admitted later, sneezing heavily. It was surrounded by plants that gave him hay fever.

Huang先生经常使用这种自嘲式幽默。3月18日，当他登上Nvidia年度开发者大会的舞台时，受到了11000名观众的欢呼、闪光灯和摇滚明星般的爱戴。他开玩笑地提醒他们，这不是一场音乐会。相反，他答应给他们带来一场充满科学、算法、计算机架构和数学的浓烈混合。有人发出了欢呼声。

Mr Huang uses such self-deprecating humour often. When he took to the stage on March 18th for Nvidia’s annual developers’ conference, to be greeted by cheers, camera flashes and rock-star adulation from the 11,000 folk packed into a San Jose ice-hockey stadium, he jokingly reminded them it wasn’t a concert. Instead, he promised them a heady mix of science, algorithms, computer architecture and mathematics. Someone whooped.

在此之前，华尔街上的Nvidia粉丝们将其誉为“**AI**伍德斯托克”。实际情况并非如此。与会者大多是穿着带着绳牌和便鞋的中年男性，而不是戴着珠子和打印衫的年轻人。然而，Jensen Huang在亮相时有点像吉米·亨德里克斯。他穿着标志性的皮夹克，表现得令人振奋。他在让复杂的事情听起来简单方面是一位大师。在媒体面前，他充满表演精神地即兴表演。尽管他的风度十足，但他那改变世界的雄心，令人陶醉。如果有人毫不犹豫地将“**gen AI**”推向极限，那就是Huang先生。这带来一个问题：他是否面临任何限制呢？

In advance, Nvidia’s fans on Wall Street had dubbed it the “AI Woodstock”. It wasn’t that. The attendees were mostly middle-aged men wearing lanyards and loafers, not beads and tie-dyes. Yet as a headliner, there was a bit of Jimi Hendrix about Jensen Huang. Wearing his trademark leather jacket, he put on an exhilarating performance. He was a virtuoso at making complex stuff sound easy. In front of the media, he improvised with showmanship. And for all the polished charm, there was something intoxicating about his change-the-world ambition. If anyone is pushing “gen AI” to the limits, with no misgivings, Mr Huang is. This raises a question: what constraints, if any, does he face?

这次会议的目的是提供一个简单的答案：没有。这是新工业革命的开始，根据Huang先生的说法，Nvidia是第一个准备打造未来“**AI**工厂”的公司。对于**AI**建模师最喜欢的处理器类型——[Nvidia的图形处理单元](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/02/27/why-do-nvidias-chips-dominate-the-ai-market)（**GPUs**）的需求是如此旺盛，以至于供不应求。没关系。Nvidia宣布将于今年晚些时候推出一款名为Blackwell的新一代超级芯片，比其现有**GPUs**强大多倍，承诺将带来更大更聪明的**AI**。Huang先生表示，正是由于**AI**的推动，去年全球数据中心的支出达到了2500亿美元，并以每年20%的速度增长。他的公司打算在其中获得很大一部分增长。为了让竞争对手更难迎头赶上，Nvidia将Blackwell的**GPU**定价在每台3万至4万美元，华尔街认为这是保守的。

The aim of the conference was to offer a simple answer: none. This is the start of a new industrial revolution and, according to Mr Huang, Nvidia is first in line to build the “AI factories” of the future. Demand for [Nvidia’s graphics-processing units](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/02/27/why-do-nvidias-chips-dominate-the-ai-market) (GPUs), AI-modellers’ favourite type of processor, is so insatiable that they are in short supply. No matter. Nvidia announced the launch later this year of a new generation of superchips, named Blackwell, that are many times more powerful than its existing GPUs, promising bigger and cleverer AIs. Thanks to AI, spending on global data centres was $250bn last year, Mr Huang says, and is growing at 20% a year. His company intends to capture much of that growth. To make it more difficult for rivals to catch up, Nvidia is pricing Blackwell GPUs at $30,000-40,000 apiece, which Wall Street deems conservative.

为了收获这种“加速计算”的果实，Nvidia希望大幅扩大其客户群。目前，其**GPU**的主要用户是云计算巨头，如Alphabet、亚马逊和微软，以及**gen-AI**模型的构建者，如ChatGPT的制造商OpenAI。但Nvidia看到了来自各个行业的需求巨大机会：从医疗保健、零售到制造业，应有尽有。该公司相信，许多企业很快将不再只是玩弄ChatGPT，而是开始部署自己的**gen AI**。为此，Nvidia将提供自包含的软件包，可以直接购买或根据用户需求定制。它们被称为NIMs，即Nvidia推理微服务。重要的是，它们将依赖于（主要是租赁的）Nvidia **GPUs**，进一步将客户与公司的硬件-软件生态系统联系在一起。

In order to reap the fruits of this “accelerated-computing”, Nvidia wants to vastly expand its customer base. Currently the big users of its GPUs are the cloud-computing giants, such as Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft, as well as builders of gen-AI models, such as OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT. But Nvidia sees great opportunity in demand from [firms across all industries](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/02/29/how-businesses-are-actually-using-generative-ai): health care, retail, manufacturing, you name it. It believes that many businesses will soon move on from toying with ChatGPT to deploying their own gen AIs. For that, Nvidia will provide self-contained software packages that can either be acquired off the shelf or tailored to a user’s needs. It calls them NIMs, Nvidia Inference Microservices. Crucially, they will rely on (mostly rented) Nvidia GPUs, further tying customers into the firm’s hardware-software ecosystem.

目前看起来，一切都是那么光彩夺目。但在伍德斯托克并非一帆风顺。只需回想一下疫情期间的供应链问题，以及随后的中美芯片之争，就会发现潜在的危险。Nvidia目前的**GPU**系列已经面临上游瓶颈问题。用于Nvidia产品的高带宽存储芯片的韩国制造商无法满足需求。世界最大的半导体制造商台积电也没能生产足够的先进封装材料，将**GPU**和存储芯片绑定在一起。此外，Nvidia更大的集成系统中包含约60万个零部件，其中许多来自中国。如果美国与其战略竞争对手的紧张关系继续升级，这将突显地缘政治风险。

So far, so star-spangled. But it is not all peace and love at Woodstock. You need only to recall the supply-chain problems of the pandemic, as well as the subsequent Sino-American chip wars, to see that [dangers lurk](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/01/the-ai-boom-has-turbocharged-nvidias-fortunes-can-it-hold-its-position). Nvidia’s current line-up of GPUs already faces upstream bottlenecks. South Korean makers of high-bandwidth memory chips used in Nvidia’s products cannot keep up with demand. TSMC, the world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer, which actually churns out Nvidia chips, is struggling to make enough of the advanced packaging that binds GPUs and memory chips together. Moreover, Nvidia’s larger integrated systems contain around 600,000 components, many of which come from China. That underscores the geopolitical risks if America’s tensions with its strategic rival keep mounting.

问题也可能存在于下游。**AI**芯片耗电量巨大，并且需要大量冷却。由于装有大量**GPU**的数据中心对电网施加的压力，人们越来越担心会出现电力短缺。Huang先生希望通过使**GPU**更加高效来解决这个问题。他表示，被简要命名为GB200NVL72的最强Blackwell系统，可以使用大约四分之一的电力训练比ChatGPT更大的模型，比目前可获得的处理器要节约电力。

Troubles may lie downstream, too. The AIchips are energy-hungry and need plenty of cooling. There are growing fears of power shortages because of the strain that GPU-stuffed data centres will put on the grid. Mr Huang hopes to solve this problem by making GPUs more efficient. He says the mightiest Blackwell system, known pithily as GB200NVL72, can train a model larger than ChatGPT using about a quarter as much electrical power as the best available processors.

但是，克鲁索能源系统总裁Chase Lochmiller指出，这仍然比前**AI**数据中心服务器高出近20倍。克鲁索能源系统提供低碳云服务，并已签约购买GB200NVL72。而且，无论它们的能效有多高，**GPU**越大，使用它们训练出的**AI**可能会更好。这将激发**AI**需求，进而推动**GPU**需求。正如经济学家在19世纪末的一次工业革命中指出的那样，效率提高反而可能增加能源消耗，而不是减少。分析公司New Street Research的Pierre Ferragu表示：“你无法像增加芯片供应那样迅速增加电力供应。”在这个时代的一个迹象是，在线零售商亚马逊的云计算部门本月购买了一个核动力数据中心。

But that is still almost 20 times more than pre-AI data-centre servers, notes Chase Lochmiller, boss of Crusoe Energy Systems, which provides low-carbon cloud services and has signed up to buy the GB200NVL72. And however energy-efficient they are, the bigger the GPUs, the better the AIs trained using them are likely to be. This will stoke demand for AIs and, by extension, for GPUs. In that way, as economists pointed out during a previous industrial revolution in the late 19th century, efficiency can raise power consumption rather than reduce it. “You can’t grow the supply of power anything like as fast as you can grow the supply of chips,” says Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research, a firm of analysts. In a sign of the times Amazon Web Services, the online retailer’s cloud division, this month bought a nuclear-powered data centre.

尽管放弃更典型的关于**gen AI**可能会摧毁工作或消灭人类的担忧，但Huang先生并不忽视这些风险。在他看来，技术最终将提升生产力、创造利润并创造就业机会——这都会造福人类。亨德里克斯曾经认为音乐是改变世界的唯一方式。对于Huang先生，这是一种科学、工程和数学的浓烈混合。■

Mr Huang is not blind to these risks, even as he dismisses the more typical concerns about gen AI—that it will destroy work or wipe out humanity. In his telling, the technology will end up boosting productivity, generating profits and creating jobs—all to the betterment of humankind. Hendrix famously believed music was the only way to change the world. For Mr Huang, it is a heady mix of science, engineering and maths. ■

欧洲希望初创企业用超级计算机进行人工智能 (Europe wants startups to do AI with supercomputers)
======================================================================

这个想法在纸面上很吸引人，但在实践中充满困难。 (The idea is appealing on paper but fraught in practice)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

![The Juwels supercomputer at the Julich Research Centre.](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_WBP003.jpg)

**在由Nvidia打造的JuLi中心研究中心的Juwels超级计算机。**

IT IS NOT just technology firms that are fighting over the AI pie. Countries, too, want a bigger slice. As with companies, national spoils are unevenly distributed. If America is big tech, Europe looks more like an early-stage startup. Whereas America boasts many computing clusters of more than 20,000 top-end AI chips, in Europe a 1,000-processor facility counts as big. The EU hopes to give its AI startups a boost by tapping its growing fleet of supercomputers. This idea was one of the themes of the EuroHPC Summit, which drew Europe’s supercomputing experts to Antwerp on March 18th-21st. The gathering drew less attention than the concomitant “Woodstock of AI” hosted in Silicon Valley by [Nvidia](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/20/can-anything-stop-nvidias-jensen-huang), the unstoppable maker of AI chips. But for Europe’s AI ambitions, the meeting in Belgium may end up playing an important role.

不仅仅是科技公司争夺**AI**大饼，国家也想要更大的一块。与公司一样，国家的战利品分配是不均衡的。如果说美国代表着大型科技公司，那么欧洲看起来更像是**早期创业公司**。在美国有许多拥有超过20,000个**顶级**AI芯片的计算集群的同时，欧洲一个拥有1,000个处理器的设施就算是大型了。欧盟希望通过利用其不断增长的**超级计算机**队伍来为**AI**初创公司带来提振。这一想法是EuroHPC峰会的一个主题，此次峰会于3月18日至21日在安特卫普汇聚了欧洲超级计算专家。与在美国硅谷由**Nvidia**主办的“AI伍德斯托克”同时举办的“AI伍德斯托克”相比，这次聚会受到的关注较少，**Nvidia**是一家不可阻挡的**AI芯片**制造商。但对于欧洲的**AI**抱负来说，比利时的这次会议可能会扮演一个重要的角色。

After falling behind America and China in supercomputing, in 2018 the EU launched EuroHPC, a bloc-wide project to expand number-crunching capacity. The outfit is set to spend nearly €8bn ($8.7bn) between 2018 and 2027 on a dozen or so new supercomputers. Of the nine already built, three rank among the world’s ten most powerful machines. They have lifted Europe’s share of global supercomputing power from 15% in 2020 to 22%. In September Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, declared that this oomph would be made available to European AI startups free of charge.

在**超级计算机**领域落后于美国和中国之后，欧盟于2018年推出了EuroHPC，这是一个旨在扩大**数学**运算能力的整个**区域**项目。该组织计划在2018年至2027年之间花费近80亿欧元（87亿美元）用于建造十几台新**超级计算机**。在已经建成的九台机器中，有三台位列全球十大最强大的机器之列。这些机器将欧洲在全球**超级计算**能力中的份额从2020年的15%提升到了22%。欧盟委员会主席乌尔苏拉·冯·德莱恩在9月宣布，这种**动力**将免费提供给欧洲**AI**初创公司。

Supercomputers used to be the preserve of scientists who were simulating complex things like the climate or chemical reactions. A typical machine was a collection of tens of thousands of general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) similar to those that power personal computers, but souped up and connected via ultrafast networks. Nowadays some supercomputers also contain thousands of graphics-processing units (GPUs). These specialist chips, whose production is dominated by Nvidia, were originally designed with video games in mind. By mathematical happenstance, they also turn out to be just the thing for building AI models.

**超级计算机**过去是科学家模拟复杂事物（如气候或化学反应）的专利。一个典型的**机器**是数万个类似于个人电脑动力来源的通用中央处理单元（CPU）的集合，但经过了优化和通过**超快速的**网络连接。如今，一些**超级计算机**还包含数千个图形处理单元（GPU）。这些专用芯片的生产由**Nvidia**主导，最初是为了设计视频游戏而开发的。在数学巧合的情况下，它们也是构建**AI模型**的理想选择。

AI firms regularly spend a big chunk of the money they raise from venture capitalists to buy such processors or rent them from cloud-computing providers. And American startups, with their deeper pockets, find it easier than European ones to secure the necessary computing resources. The EU wants EuroHPC’s machines to help level the playing field. It plans to equip these with additional GPUs. And it intends to build data centres close to the supercomputers, which would enable firms to harness their computing power.

**AI**公司经常将从风险投资人那里筹集的大部分资金用于购买这些处理器或从云计算提供商那里租用它们。由于美国初创公司资金更充裕，他们比欧洲公司更容易获得所需的计算资源。欧盟希望EuroHPC的机器能够帮助实现公平竞争。它计划为这些机器配备额外的**GPU**。并计划在**超级计算机**附近建立数据中心，这将使企业能够利用它们的计算能力。

One of the first such “AI factories”, as the EU calls them, is likely to emerge in Jülich, a town in western Germany. A nearby research centre, where Germany once tested nuclear reactors, is already home to two powerful supercomputers. If all goes well, this autumn it will add a €500m machine that will be Europe’s zippiest. Thanks in part to nearly 24,000 advanced Nvidia GPUs, it will be able to perform a mind-bending billion calculations every billionth of a second. The total amount of GPU power in Jülich is comparable to what OpenAI, America’s leading AI startup, used to train GPT-4, its best model so far. For a European startup, that is real muscle.

欧盟称之为“**AI工厂**”之一的地方可能会在德国西部的Jülich出现。附近的一个研究中心，曾经是德国测试核反应堆的地方，已经拥有两台强大的**超级计算机**。如果一切顺利，今年秋天，它将增加一台价值5亿欧元的机器，这将是欧洲**速度最快**的机器。多亏了近24,000个**先进的Nvidia** GPUs，它将能够每秒执行数十亿次计算。Jülich的GPU总计与美国领先的**AI**初创公司OpenAI用于训练迄今为止的最佳模型GPT-4的计算力相当。对于一个欧洲初创公司来说，这是**强大的支持**。

Can this approach work at scale? Thomas Lippert, who heads the centre in Jülich, got lucky by ordering Nvidia GPUs a couple of years ago, before demand for them (and their price) exploded. Mr Lippert’s counterparts at the other supercomputers may now find it harder get their hands on such chips. Alternatives to Nvidia exist, but most model-makers prefer to work with the company’s popular software platform. Silo AI, a Finnish firm, had to develop a lot of code before it could train its AI on Lumi, a supercomputer in Finland that runs on GPUs from AMD, Nvidia’s main competitor. What is more, the EU’s efforts to shore up local chip manufacturing will take years to materialise.

这种方法在规模上是否奏效？Jülich中心的负责人托马斯·利珀特在几年前订购**Nvidia** GPUs时运气不错，之后这类芯片的需求（以及价格）激增。现在，Jülich中心的其他负责人可能会发现更难得到这样的芯片。虽然有替代品，但大多数模型制造商更倾向于使用该公司的热门软件平台。芬兰公司Silo**AI**在其位于芬兰的Lumi**上训练AI之前，不得不开发很多代码，并通过**Nvidia**的主要竞争对手之一AMD的GPU。此外，欧盟加强本地芯片制造的努力将需要数年时间才能实现。

Even if EuroHPC can somehow secure the necessary hardware, other challenges remain. Supercomputers are “alien” to machine-learning boffins used to data-centre servers, says Anders Dam Jensen, who heads EuroHPC. Although each AI factory is meant to include resources to help firms adapt their projects for supercomputers, Europe’s most promising AI firms may prefer to avoid the hassle.

即使**EuroHPC**不知何故地获得了必要的硬件，仍然存在其他挑战。 “**超级计算机**对于习惯于数据中心服务器的机器学习专家来说是‘陌生的’”，EuroHPC主管安德斯·达姆·詹森表示。虽然每个**AI工厂**都应该包括资源，以帮助企业调整他们的项目以适应**超级计算机**，但欧洲最有前途的**AI**公司可能更倾向于避开这些麻烦。

And whereas in the commercial cloud getting computing power is largely a question of money, the free access to European supercomputers is subject to peer review, which means that winners are picked by committee (scientists, for one, aren’t too happy about sharing the machines with startups). It also comes with the obligation to make the results of users’ work public, something that many commercial endeavours will probably balk at. This may be why Mistral, a hot French model-maker, used an Italian supercomputer for some experiments but actually trained its latest model with the help of CoreWeave, an American cloud provider of GPU power. ■

而在商业云中，获得计算能力很大程度上是一个金钱问题，访问欧洲**超级计算机**却要经过同行评议，这意味着获奖者是由委员会（其中包括科学家）挑选出来的（科学家对于与初创公司分享这些机器并不太满意）。这也意味着必须将用户工作的结果公开，许多商业活动可能会对此提出异议。这可能是为什么炙手可热的法国模型制造商Mistral在一些实验中使用了意大利的**超级计算机**，但实际上还是通过美国云提供商CoreWeave帮助培训了其最新模型。■

中国、俄罗斯和伊朗如何密切合作 (How China, Russia and Iran are forging closer ties)
=================================================================

评估由反西方联盟构成的经济威胁 (Assessing the economic threat posed by the anti-Western axis)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

![习近平、弗拉基米尔 · 普京和埃布拉欣 · 雷西的插图，描绘成从大到小的俄罗斯套娃。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FND001.jpg)

俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔 · 普京（Vladimir Putin）和伊朗总统埃布拉欣 · 雷西（Ebrahim Raisi）有几个共同点。两人都是美国个人制裁的少数领导人之一。尽管两人很少出访，但近年来都曾访问中国。两人似乎对彼此日益倾心。去年12月，他们在克里姆林宫会晤，讨论了加沙地带的战争。3月18日，雷西迅速祝贺普京获得“决定性”选举胜利。

Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, and Ebrahim Raisi, his Iranian counterpart, have several things in common. Both belong to a tiny group of leaders personally targeted by American sanctions. Even though neither travels much, both have been to China in recent years. And both seem increasingly fond of one another. In December they met in the Kremlin to discuss the war in Gaza. On March 18th Mr Raisi was quick to congratulate Mr Putin on his “decisive” election victory.

在大部分历史中，俄罗斯、伊朗和中国之间并不那么亲密。作为内心的帝国主义者，它们常常干预对方的邻国事务，并争夺亚洲贸易路线的控制权。然而，最近美国改变了这种动态。两年前退出限制伊朗核计划的协议后，美国于2020年重新对伊朗实施贸易禁运；今年1月，为惩罚伊朗支持哈马斯和胡塞反叛分子，更多制裁措施相继宣布。俄罗斯于2022年入侵乌克兰后遭到西方制裁，最近这些制裁措施更加严厉。与此同时，中国面临着自己的限制，如果唐纳德 · 特朗普在11月当选总统，这些限制就可能变得更加严格。三国因共同敌人而团结在一起，如今誓言推动一项共同的外交政策：支持一个不再被美国主导的多极世界。他们都将更加紧密的经济联系视为联盟的基础。

For much of history, Russia, Iran and China were less chummy. Imperialists at heart, they often meddled in one another’s neighbourhoods and jostled for control of Asia’s trade routes. Lately, however, America has changed the dynamic. In 2020, two years after exiting a deal [limiting Iran’s nuclear programme](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/05/08/donald-trumps-huge-iran-gamble), it reimposed a trade embargo on the country; more penalties were announced in January, to punish Iran for backing Hamas and Houthi rebels. Russia fell under Western sanctions in 2022, after invading Ukraine, which were recently tightened. Meanwhile, China faces restrictions of its own, which could become much more stringent if Donald Trump is elected president in November. United by a common foe, the trio now vow to advance a common foreign policy: support for a multipolar world no longer dominated by America. All see stronger economic ties as the basis for their alliance.

中国承诺与俄罗斯建立一个“**无限**”伙伴关系，并于2021年与伊朗签署了一项为期25年的“战略协议”。这三个国家都是金砖国家等多边组织的成员。双边贸易不断增长；已经制定了免关税集团、新的支付系统以及避开西方管控地区的贸易路线的计划。对于美国及其盟国来说，这是噩梦的源头。一个兴盛的反西方阵营可以规避制裁、赢得战争并招募其他有恶意的参与者。这种协定涉及领域，一些领域的联系已经很密切，另一些领域仅有部分合作，还有一些问题有待解决。这个联盟在五到十年内会是什么样子？

China has promised [a “no limits” partnership](https://www.economist.com/china/chinas-friendship-with-russia-has-boundaries-despite-what-their-leaders-say/21808197) with Russia, and signed a 25-year “strategic agreement” with Iran in 2021. All three countries are members of the same multilateral clubs, such as the BRICS. Bilateral trade is growing; plans are being drawn up for tariff-free blocs, new payment systems and trade routes that bypass Western-controlled places. For America and its allies, this is the stuff of nightmares. A thriving anti-Western axis could dodge sanctions, win wars and recruit other malign actors. The entente involves areas where links are already strong, others where collaboration is only partial and some unresolved questions. What might the alliance look like in five to ten years?

从蓬勃发展的贸易谈起。中国长期以来一直是石油输出国的大客户，包括伊朗和俄罗斯。但这两个国家过去也向欧洲出口大量石油，因为欧洲靠近俄罗斯的油田，从海湾地区到那里也很方便。自从欧洲开始拒绝它们后，中国便以低价购买原油。据数据公司Kpler的Reid l’Anson估计，俄罗斯西部港口的原油进口量已从战前不到10万桶/日增至50万桶/日。去年12月，俄罗斯原油进口量达到每日220万桶，占中国总进口量的19%，比两年前的150万桶/日多。去年下半年，伊朗对中国的石油出口平均每日达到100万桶，比2021年同期增长了150%。

Start with booming business. China has long been a big customer of petrostates, including Iran and Russia. But these two also used to sell lots of oil to Europe, which was close to Russia’s fields and easy to reach from the Gulf. Since Europe started snubbing them, China has been buying barrels at bargain prices. Inflows from Russia’s western ports have risen to 500,000 barrels a day (b/d), from less than 100,000 pre-war, reckons Reid l’Anson of Kpler, a data firm. In December imports of Russian crude reached 2.2m b/d, or 19% of China’s total, from 1.5m b/d two years ago. In the second half of last year, Iran’s exports to China averaged 1m b/d, a 150% rise from the same period in 2021.

与西方制裁允许除G7国家以外的任何人继续进口俄罗斯石油不同，伊朗能源行业受到所谓的次级制裁的约束，这些制裁限制了第三国。然而，自2022年以来，拜登政府已经放松执法，并愿意看到规定被打破，如果这意味着更低的价格。结果是[中国的进口激增](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/01/why-the-wests-oil-sanctions-on-russia-are-proving-to-be-underwhelming)，受益者不是中国的国有企业，这些企业将有一天可能面临制裁，而是没有海外存在的较小的“小茶壶精炼厂”。中国还从俄罗斯获得廉价天然气：通过西伯利亚力量管道的进口量自普京入侵乌克兰以来已经翻了一番。

Whereas Western sanctions allow anyone outside the G7 to still import Russian oil, the Iranian energy industry is subject to so-called secondary sanctions, which restrict third countries. Since 2022, however, the Biden administration has relaxed enforcement and is willing to see rules broken if it means lower prices. The result has been a surge in [Chinese imports](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/01/why-the-wests-oil-sanctions-on-russia-are-proving-to-be-underwhelming), with the beneficiaries not China’s state-owned firms, which could one day be exposed to sanctions, but smaller “teapot refineries” with no presence abroad. China also gets cheap gas from Russia: imports via the Power of Siberia pipeline have doubled since Mr Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

俄罗斯和伊朗别无选择，只能向中国出售原油。相反，中国只受制于对西方技术进口的限制——并没有面临金融禁令或贸易禁运。因此，中国可以并且确实从其他国家购买石油，这使其在与盟友谈判中处于上风。中国以比全球油价低15-30美元/桶的折扣购买俄罗斯和伊朗的石油，然后加工这些廉价碳氢化合物，将它们转化为更高价值的产品。过去两年，中国的石化行业生产能力的增长超过自2019年以来全球所有其他国家的总和。中国还生产出大量精炼油产品。

Russia and Iran have little choice but to sell to China. In contrast, China is only subject to restrictions on imports of Western technology—it does not face financial bans or trade embargoes. Therefore it can, and does, buy oil from other countries, which gives it the upper hand in negotiations with its allies. China gets Russian and Iranian supplies at a discount of $15-30 a barrel on the global oil price, and then processes the cheap hydrocarbons, turning them into higher-value products. The production capacity of its petrochemicals industry has grown more in the past two years than that of all other countries combined since 2019. China also cranks out enormous volumes of refined-oil products.

在这三个国家之间增加大宗商品贸易本来就是件容易的事。每个人都需要石油；一旦装上船，它就可以被送到任何地方。然而，中国有一个非正式政策，即将对任何大宗商品供应国的依赖限制在总需求的15-20%左右，这意味着其从俄罗斯进口的量接近其希望的最大值。尽管这种贸易仍足以为俄罗斯和伊朗提供生机，但只有当他们能够用赚取的硬通货来进口商品时才有帮助。因此，有发展其他类型贸易的雄心。

Boosting commodity trade between the three countries was always going to be the easy bit. Everyone wants oil; once on a ship, it can be sent anywhere. Yet China has an informal policy of limiting dependence on any commodity supplier to 15-20% of its total needs, meaning that it is close to the maximum it will want to import from Russia. Although the trade is still enough to provide Russia and Iran with a lifeline, it is helpful only if they can spend the hard currency earned on importing goods. Hence the ambition to develop other types of trade.

![第一幅插图](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FNC452.png)

中国对俄罗斯的出口也相应激增。由于COVID-19规定束缚了中国的经济，中国试图通过增加制造业出口来弥补。中国尝试销售高价值商品，例如机械设备，在俄罗斯作为测试市场。去年，中国汽车的最大进口国不是欧洲（那里是其电动车的目的地），而是俄罗斯，购买的汽油车数量比战前增加了三倍。

China’s exports to Russia have duly soared. As covid-19 rules strangled its economy, China sought to compensate by boosting manufacturing exports. Instead of shoes and t-shirts, it tried to sell high-value wares, such as machinery and mechanical devices, for which Russia acted as a test market. Last year the biggest importer of Chinese automobiles was not Europe, a destination for its electric vehicles, but Russia, which purchased three times as many petrol cars it did as before the war.

采购管理人员的调查显示，伊朗公司在“原材料”方面经常短缺，这一范畴包括复杂的商品，如计算机芯片，以及更基础的商品，例如塑料零件。这妨碍了伊朗的制造业，该制造业规模与石油行业相当。然而，中国向伊朗出口的零部件很少，每月只有300-500辆汽车，相比之下，向邻国伊拉克出口的量约为3000辆左右。中国的制造商品出口商中，有很多向西方出口大量商品的公司并不敢冒险冒美国的惩罚风险。

Purchasing-manager surveys show that Iranian companies are constantly short of “raw materials”, a category including both sophisticated wares, like computer chips, and more basic ones, such as plastic parts. This hampers Iran’s manufacturing industry, which is as large as its petroleum sector. Yet China exports few parts and just 300-500 cars a month to Iran, compared with 3,000 or so to neighbouring Iraq. Not many of China’s manufactured-goods exporters, which sell a lot to the West, are brave enough to risk American retribution.

理论上，与俄罗斯的更多业务可能有助于伊朗。这两个国家互相提供有用的商品。自2022年以来，伊朗已向俄罗斯出售了在乌克兰造成破坏的无人机和武器系统——这是自1979年革命以来伊朗首次为非伊斯兰国家提供军事支持。今年初，伊朗还通过油轮向俄罗斯运送了100万桶原油，这也是首次。但是制裁使加深联系变得棘手。尽管俄罗斯于2023年停止发布详细统计数据，但里海船舶数据显示，自2022年以来，当该国领导人设定了提升双边贸易宏伟目标后，只有一点点增长。

In theory, more business with Russia could help Iran. The two countries supply each other with useful goods. Since 2022 Iran has sold Russia drones and weapons systems that are causing damage in Ukraine—its first military support for a non-Islamic country since the revolution in 1979. Early this year Iran also sent Russia 1m barrels of crude by tanker, another first. But sanctions make deeper ties tricky. Although Russia stopped releasing detailed statistics in 2023, ship-traffic data in the Caspian Sea show only a modest rise since 2022, when the country’s leaders set an ambitious target to boost bilateral trade.

伊朗和俄罗斯之间有限的贸易交易意味着它们缺乏共同的银行渠道和支付系统。尽管政府施加压力，但伊朗银行很少使用SPFS（俄罗斯对SWIFT的替代，即全球银行间通信系统）或Mir（俄罗斯对美国信用卡网络的回应）。努力实现贸易去美元化导致了2022年8月卢布-里亚尔汇率机制的创建，但交易量仍然很低。

Limited trade between Iran and Russia means they lack common banking channels and payment systems. Despite government pressure, neither SPFS (Russia’s alternative to SWIFT, the global interbank messaging system) nor Mir (Russia’s answer to American credit-card networks) is widely used by Iranian banks. Efforts to de-dollarise trade led to the creation of a rouble-rial exchange mechanism in August 2022, but transaction volumes remain low.

为了长期抵制制裁，伊朗和俄罗斯还需要投资——这是当前合作的最薄弱领域。自2014年以来，中国在伊朗的外国直接投资存量保持不变，尽管它在其他新兴经济体投入了大量资金，规模约30亿美元对于伊朗这样一个经济体规模的国家来说太微不足道了。在伊朗总统最后一次访问北京期间达成的协议中，价值最多可能为100亿美元，远不及中国在2022年承诺向伊朗的宿敌沙特阿拉伯提供的500亿美元。

To resist sanctions in the longer run, Iran and Russia also need investment—the weakest area of co-operation at present. China’s stock of foreign direct investment in the Islamic Republic has been flat since 2014, even as it has poured money into other emerging economies, and at roughly $3bn remains puny for an economy of Iran’s size. Deals agreed during the last visit of Iran’s president to Beijing, which could be valued at $10bn at most, are dwarfed by the $50bn China pledged to Saudi Arabia, Iran’s great rival, in 2022.

尽管中国仍参与俄罗斯项目，如位于俄罗斯北部的北极液化天然气项目，但它没有收购西方公司抛售的资产，如思南(CNAS)智库的Rachel Ziemba指出，也没有支持新企业。俄罗斯原本期望中国资助“西伯利亚力量2”管道，该管道完工后将向中国供应500亿立方米的天然气，几乎等同于俄罗斯最大管道过去供应给欧洲的量。没有中国的支持，该项目现在陷入停滞。

Although China remains involved in Russian projects such as Arctic LNG, a gas-liquefaction facility in the country’s north, it has not snapped up assets dumped by Western firms, notes Rachel Ziemba of CNAS, a think-tank, nor backed new ventures. Russia had been expecting China to bankroll the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, due to carry 50bn cubic metres of gas to the Middle Kingdom when complete—almost as much as Russia’s biggest pipeline used to deliver to Europe. Without China’s support, the project is now in limbo.

这个联盟已经取得了一项非凡成就：在西方禁运的压力下挽救了其次要成员国的崩溃。但它是否已经发挥出最大潜力？答案取决于其成员克服外部和内部障碍的能力。

The alliance has already achieved something remarkable: saving its junior members from collapse in the face of Western embargoes. But has it reached its full potential? The answer depends on the ability of its members to surmount external and internal obstacles.

各种论坛旨在促进合作和跨境投资。去年7月，伊朗成为上海合作组织的第九个成员，该组织是由中国领导的安全联盟，也包括俄罗斯。去年12月，伊朗与俄罗斯主导的欧亚经济联盟签署了自由贸易协定，该联盟覆盖了中亚大部分地区。今年1月，伊朗加入了金砖国家集团，这是一个包括中国和俄罗斯在内的新兴市场集团。

Various forums aim to promote co-operation and cross-border investment. Last July Iran became the ninth member of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, a China-led security alliance that also includes Russia. In December it signed a free-trade agreement with the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union, which covers much of Central Asia. In January it joined the BRICS, an emerging-market group that includes both China and Russia.

这些会面为这三国提供了更多对话机会。在最近的峰会上，伊朗和俄罗斯部长们重新开启协商，以延伸国际北-南运输走廊（INSTC），这是一条连接俄罗斯与印度洋的7200公里线路，通过伊朗。目前，俄罗斯谷物必须通过北约控制的博斯普鲁斯海峡去往中东。这一提议包括道路、铁路和港口的综合，可能使伊朗成为俄罗斯出口的出口港。

These get-togethers give the trio more chances to talk. At recent summits, Iranian and Russian ministers have revived negotiations to extend the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a 7,200km route connecting Russia to the Indian Ocean via Iran. At present Russian grain must travel to the Middle East through the NATO-controlled Bosporus. The proposal, which includes a mixture of roads, rail and ports, could turn Iran into an export outlet for Russia.

伊朗和俄罗斯的官僚机构相对缺乏彼此合作经验，而所需的投资金额令人生畏：由俄罗斯支持的欧亚开发银行估计仅在伊朗和俄罗斯，就需要260亿美元。在两个不以投资友好闻名的国家筹集这样的资金，即使在没有制裁的情况下也很困难，更不用说在制裁下了。尽管如此，这个想法正在引起关注。2月1日，各国使节讨论了Rasht-Astara铁路的下一步计划，这是一个耗资16亿美元的项目，可改善伊朗北部的货运运输。去年，俄罗斯首次利用INSTC的部分线路，通过铁路向伊朗运送商品。

Iran’s and Russia’s bureaucracies have relatively little experience of working with one another, and the amount of investment required is daunting: the Russia-backed Eurasian Development Bank estimates it to be $26bn in Iran and Russia alone. Mustering such funding, in two countries not known for investor friendliness, would be hard at the best of times, let alone under sanctions. Still, the idea is gaining traction. On February 1st envoys discussed the next steps for the Rasht-Astara railway, a $1.6bn project that could ease freight transport in northern Iran. Last year Russia used part of the INSTC to move goods to Iran by rail for the first time.

更为严重的问题是，伊朗和俄罗斯的经济过于相似，无法成为天然的贸易伙伴。在各自出口的前15类商品中，有九个是重叠的；它们前15大进口商品中有十个也是相同的。俄罗斯前15受欢迎的商品仅有两种包括在伊朗的主要出口产品中。在伊朗需求缺口的一些领域，如汽车、电子设备和机械，俄罗斯的生产能力受到限制。

The more serious problem is that Iran’s and Russia’s economies are too similar to be natural trading partners. Of the top 15 categories of goods that each exports, nine are shared; ten of their 15 biggest imports are also the same. Only two of Russia’s 15 most-wanted goods count among Iran’s top exports. Where Iran does have demand gaps Russia could fill, such as in cars, electronics and machinery, Russia’s production capacity is constrained.

由于制裁限制了贸易收益，这两国之间的关系将演变成竞争关系，特别是在能源方面。自西方对俄罗斯石油实施禁运以来，该国一直与伊朗竞争，争夺在中国进口中的更大份额，导致价格战。这是一场伊朗正在输掉的战争。俄罗斯是更大的石油生产国，其能源不受次要制裁影响。部分原油也可以通过管道输送到中国，这是更便宜的选择。

With gains from trade curtailed by sanctions, the relationship between the two countries will instead be a competitive one, particularly when it comes to energy. Since the West imposed an embargo on Russia’s oil, the country has been vying with Iran to win a bigger share of China’s imports, resulting in a price war. It is a battle that Iran is losing. Russia is a bigger oil producer and its energy is not subject to secondary sanctions. Some of its crude can also be piped to China, a cheaper option.

拥有优势使得俄罗斯对与伊朗合作不感兴趣。在战争初期，乌克兰的支持者担心俄罗斯和伊朗将联手规避制裁。研究机构MEES的Yesar Al-Maleki表示，相反，俄罗斯发展了自己的“影子”油轮船队，并没有向伊朗提供访问权。伊朗寻求俄罗斯的资金和技术来开发其巨大的天然气储备；到目前为止，俄罗斯提供的帮助并不多。

Having the upper hand makes Russia uninterested in collaborating with Iran. Early in the war, Ukraine’s supporters feared that Russia and Iran would team up to evade sanctions. Instead, Russia developed its own “shadow” fleet of tankers and gave no access to the Iranians, says Yesar Al-Maleki of MEES, a research outfit. Iran has sought Russian funds and technology to tap its giant gas reserves; Russia has provided little help so far.

在其他领域，中国已经成为伊朗的竞争对手。直到最近，伊斯兰共和国庞大的制造基地和国内市场是其韧性的来源。另一个智库Bourse & Bazaar Foundation的Esfandyar Batmanghelidj表示，该国可以利用货币贬值的优势出售坚果和洗涤用品之类的商品。长期以来，伊朗的希望是通过出口空调设备，甚至汽车，逐渐攀升价值链。中国正在扼杀这些梦想。随着其向更高价值出口转变，中国正在向伊朗的目标市场涌入更便宜、更优质的商品。

In other areas, China has become a competitor to Iran. Until recently, the Islamic Republic’s sizeable manufacturing base and home market was a source of resilience. The country could take advantage of a devalued currency to sell things like nuts and toiletries, says Esfandyar Batmanghelidj of Bourse & Bazaar Foundation, another think-tank. Its hope, in time, was to climb the value chain, exporting air-conditioning units and perhaps even cars. China is dashing such dreams. As it shifts towards higher-value exports, it is flooding Iran’s target markets with cheaper, better versions of these goods.

西方对于全面实施次要制裁并不怎么热衷。但现有措施将带来麻烦。去年12月，美国宣布对与俄罗斯在包括制造业和技术等行业开展交易的任何人实施惩罚。这看起来类似于2011年美国对伊朗实施的制裁，这些制裁在2015年签署核协议后被暂停。在暂停前，这些措施导致伊朗从中国的进口大幅减少。有证据显示，一些中国银行已经开始削减与俄罗斯的业务。

The West has little appetite for wholesale secondary sanctions. But existing measures will cause trouble. In December America announced penalties for anyone dealing with Russian firms in industries including manufacturing and technology. These look similar to those it imposed on Iran in 2011, which were suspended in 2015, after the nuclear deal was signed. Before the suspension, the measures caused Iran’s imports from China to plummet. There is evidence that some Chinese banks are already dumping Russian business.

尽管这些新制裁没有针对俄罗斯的能源部门，但如果银行因此暂停与这家能源巨头的业务，可能会影响俄罗斯与中国以外客户的石油贸易。自去年10月以来，美国还对50艘违反对俄罗斯制裁的油轮实施制裁；其中大约有一半尚未装载任何来自该国的石油。所有这些都使得向中国出口变得更加必要且更难，这必然会加剧与伊朗之间的竞争。美国还可能通过施压马来西亚来抑制在其水域中的石油走私，切断伊朗石油的流向。中国本身也正受到越来越多的监视。今年2月，欧盟宣布对三家据称正在帮助俄罗斯的中国公司实施制裁。

Although these new sanctions do not target Russia’s energy sector, they could hinder Russia’s oil trade with customers other than China if banks react by pausing business with the energy giant. Since October America has also imposed penalties on 50 tankers that it says breach sanctions on Russia; around half of them have not loaded any of the country’s oil since. All this is making exports to China both more necessary and more difficult for Russia, which is bound to increase competition with Iran. America could further fan the flames by leaning on Malaysia to inhibit oil smuggling in its waters, choking off Iranian flows. And China itself is under growing scrutiny. In February the EU announced sanctions on three Chinese firms it reckons are helping Russia.

因此，反西方的联盟令人担忧，但并不是真正可怕的。未来几年它将如何发展？最可能的情景是，它仍将是为中国利益服务的工具，而不会成为真正的伙伴关系。中国将尽可能利用它获取机会性收益，并停止在替代贸易路线或支付系统上投入重要资源。中国官员将不愿意对替代贸易路线或支付系统予以支持，以免危及在西方市场的生意。

At this stage, then, the anti-Western entente is worrying but not truly scary. How will it develop over the years to come? The likeliest scenario is that it remains a vehicle that serves China’s interests, rather than becoming a true partnership. China will use it for as long as it can reap opportunistic gains, and stop short of giving it full backing. The country’s officials will decline to put weight behind alternative trade routes or payment systems, not wanting to put at risk business in the West.

但如果美国，在特朗普连任的情况下，试图将中国驱逐出西方市场，情况可能会改变。如果再也没有什么可以失去的话，中国将会投入更多资源建立一个替代集团，并必然会尝试在现有关系基础上拓展其联盟。次要合作伙伴可能会感到不满：他们的制造业将因中国转移出口而遭受损失。美国也将受损：其消费者将为进口商品付出更高的代价，而在未来，其领导者将首次面临对其全球贸易体系主导地位的严重挑战。■

Yet that might change if America, perhaps during a second Trump presidency, attempts to force China out of Western markets. With nothing more to lose, China would then put far greater resources into forming an alternative bloc, and would inevitably attempt to build on existing relationships and broaden its alliances. Junior partners may not be pleased: their manufacturing industries would suffer as China redirected its exports. America would also suffer: its consumers would pay more for their imports, and in time its leaders would see the first serious challenge to their dominance of the global trading system. ■

***澄清（2024年3月21日）***：本文不再提及中国与伊朗的“战略协议”涉及4000亿美元，原因是对该数字存在不确定性。

日本结束了世界上最伟大的货币政策实验 (Japan ends the world’s greatest monetary-policy experiment)
============================================================================

官员们首次在17年后提高利率 (For the first time in 17 years, officials raise interest rates)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

![东京的黎明天际线](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FNP003.jpg)

3月19日，日本银行（BoJ）的官员宣布，在可持续通胀率达到2%的“眼前”之际，他们将废除一系列旨在让经济摆脱通货紧缩困境的措施，这标志着一项激进实验的结束。该银行将其隔夜贷款利率目标自2007年以来首次上调，从-0.1%和0%之间调整到0%和0.1%之间，成为最后一个废除负利率政策的中央银行。它还将停止购买交易所交易基金，并废除其收益率曲线控制框架，这是一种用于限制长期债券收益的工具。尽管如此，BoJ强调其立场将保持宽松：最不寻常政策的退缩并不预示着收紧周期的开始。

On March 19th officials at the Bank of Japan (BoJ) announced that, with sustainable inflation of 2% “in sight”, they would scrap a suite of measures instituted to pull the economy out of its deflationary doldrums—marking the end of a radical experiment. The bank raised its interest-rate target on overnight loans for the first time since 2007, from between minus 0.1% and zero to between zero and 0.1%, becoming the last central bank to scrap its negative-interest-rate policy. It will also stop buying exchange-traded funds and abolish its yield-curve-control framework, a tool to cap long-term bond yields. Even so, the BoJ stressed that its stance would remain accommodative: the withdrawal of its most unconventional policies does not augur the beginning of a tightening cycle.

这一转变反映了日本经济基本情况的变化。通胀率已经连续22个月超过银行的2%目标。最近的工会与大公司之间的年度谈判表明，薪资增长超过5%，这是33年来首次。东京大学的星武雄表示：“BoJ已经确认了许多人一直怀疑的事实：日本经济已经发生变化，已经摆脱通货紧缩。”这并不意味着日本经济正在蓬勃发展——消费疲弱、增长低迷。但经济不再需要一整套旨在提高通胀率的政策。当被问及新框架将称之为什么时，BoJ的行长上田和夫表示，这不需要特别的名称。这是“正常的”货币政策。

This shift reflects changes in the underlying condition of the Japanese economy. [Inflation](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/16/is-japans-economy-at-a-turning-point) has been above the bank’s 2% target for 22 months. Recent annual negotiations between trade unions and large companies suggest wage growth of more than 5% for the first time in 33 years. “The BoJ has confirmed what many people have been suspecting: the Japanese economy has changed, it has gotten out of deflation,” says Hoshi Takeo of the University of Tokyo. That hardly means Japan is booming—consumption is weak and growth is anaemic. But the economy no longer requires an entire armoury of policies designed to raise inflation. When Ueda Kazuo, the BoJ’s governor, was asked what he would call his new framework, he said it did not require a special name. It was “normal” monetary policy.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_EPC865.png)

20世纪90年代，随着资产泡沫破裂和几家金融机构破产，日本经济陷入通货紧缩。BoJ开始谨慎地尝试新工具。虽然1999年该银行将利率降至零，但次年又将其提高，结果价格再次下跌（当时有两名董事会成员反对此决定，其中一位就是上田先生）。然后，BoJ走得更远，成为战后第一个实施量化宽松（用新印的钱购买债券）的中央银行，并于2001年实施。

Japan’s economy slid into deflation in the 1990s, following the bursting of an asset bubble and the failure of several financial institutions. The BoJ began trying new tools, cautiously at first. Although in 1999 the bank cut interest rates to zero, it raised them the next year, only to see prices fall again (one of two board members opposed to the decision at the time was Mr Ueda). The BoJ then went further, becoming the first post-war central bank to implement quantitative easing—the buying of bonds with newly created money—in 2001.

然而，直到2013年新任行长黑田东彦上任，它才完全拥抱了货币政策的狂野一面。在时任首相安倍晋三的支持下，黑田先生启动了一项庞大的货币宽松计划，发誓要释放“刺破天的”刺激力量。该银行制定了2%的通胀目标，并开始实施“量化和质化宽松”，即大规模购买政府债券，配合积极的前瞻性指导（保持政策宽松的承诺）。2016年，该银行将其隔夜利率设定为-0.1%，意味着商业银行实际上需要为在其存款，然后实施了收益曲线控制以约束长期利率。尽管通胀有所上涨，但在黑田先生任内，通胀从未持续达到中央银行的目标，他的任期在将近一年前结束。

Yet it did not fully embrace the wild side of monetary policy until the arrival of Kuroda Haruhiko as governor in 2013. Backed by then-prime minister Abe Shinzo, Mr Kuroda embarked on a programme of vast monetary easing, vowing to unleash [a “bazooka” of stimulus](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2014/11/08/big-bazookas). The bank adopted a 2% inflation target and began “quantitative and qualitative easing”, which saw enormous government-bond purchases coupled with aggressive forward guidance (promises to keep policy loose). In 2016 the bank set its key overnight rate at minus 0.1%, meaning that commercial banks were in effect charged for depositing with it, and then implemented yield-curve control in order to restrain longer-term interest rates, too. Although inflation picked up a bit, it never consistently reached the central bank’s target during Mr Kuroda’s term, which ended nearly a year ago.

官员们现在确信，通胀最终已经根深蒂固。供应链问题和进口成本上涨最初推升了通胀率，但此后价格上涨已经变得普遍。2023年最后一个季度的国内生产总值增长数据最近已被修订为正值，这要归因于资本支出的增加。

Officials are now confident that inflation has at last become embedded. Supply-chain snags and rising import costs pushed up inflation at first, but price rises have since become widespread. GDP growth figures for the last quarter of 2023 were recently revised into positive territory owing to an uptick in capital expenditure.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_EPC863.png)

这个拼图中缺失的一块是[工资。](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/04/13/after-decades-of-stagnation-wages-in-japan-are-finally-rising)去年的年度工资谈判产生了3.8%的增长，是三十年来最高的。但工资增长仍落后于通胀，实际收入持续下降。然后就在上周，出现了重大的数据。其中包括日本工资的所谓基准部分大幅提升，这部分与资历无关。长时间的价格上涨使工会有了要求提高工资的更大动力；日本人口减少也迫使公司竞争人才。前BoJ副行长中曾大志表示：“政策制定者一直非常耐心，故意等待时机成熟。”现在时机正当。

The missing piece of the puzzle had been [wages.](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/04/13/after-decades-of-stagnation-wages-in-japan-are-finally-rising) Last year annual wage negotiations produced gains of 3.8%, the highest in three decades. But wage growth still trailed inflation, leaving real incomes falling. Then came last week’s blockbuster numbers. They included a big boost to the so-called base-up portion of Japanese wages, which is not linked to seniority. A sustained period of rising prices has emboldened unions to push forcefully for higher pay; Japan’s shrinking labour force is also forcing firms to compete for talent. Policymakers “have been very, very patient, deliberately waiting for the right timing”, says Nakaso Hiroshi, a former BoJ deputy governor. “And now the time is right.”

对于如此重大的决定，短期影响将有限。BoJ已经暗示了其意图，这意味着市场已经为此做好了预期，并在去年放宽了其收益上限。日元兑美元在宣布后略有贬值。长期收益率已稳定在0.7%至0.8%，低于被废除的1%参考点。尽管一些地方投资者可能会由于政策转变而资金回流，但由于日本的利率仍将低于国际标准，全球资本流动不太可能发生剧变，研究机构野村研究所的木内隆秀指出。政策利率的变化也不会产生太大影响：在BoJ的旧框架下，有三个帐户层次，存放在那些受负利率影响的账户中的资金比例微乎其微。

For such a momentous decision, the short-term impact will be limited. The BoJ had hinted at its intentions, meaning markets priced in the move, and had loosened its yield cap last year. The yen depreciated slightly against the dollar following the announcement. Long-term yields have settled at 0.7% to 0.8%, below the scrapped 1% reference point. Although some local investors may bring funds home as a consequence of the policy shift, global capital flows are unlikely to move drastically since rates in Japan will still be low by international standards, notes Kiuchi Takahide of Nomura Research Institute, a research outfit. Nor will the change to the policy rate have a big effect: under the BoJ’s old framework, there were three tiers of accounts, and the share of funds held in those subject to negative rates was minimal.

现在的问题是BoJ接下来该如何行动。官员们一直小心地表示，他们并未开始进行收紧政策。上个月，副行长内田申一表示不会迅速一连串地加息。上田先生对于利率将稳定在何处没有给出太多线索；大多数经济学家认为利率不会超过0.5%。BoJ还将继续“大致购买相同数量”的政府债券以控制长期利率。对自己资产负债表的正常化将是一个渐进过程。“BoJ在市场上留下了巨大的烙印，”智库东株研究所的加藤伊鹤说。“它们希望减少这种烙印，但不能突然减少。”。

The question is where the BoJ goes from here. Officials have been careful to signal they are not embarking on a tightening cycle. Last month Uchida Shinichi, a deputy governor, said there would not be a rapid series of rate rises. Mr Ueda offered few clues about where he suspects rates will settle; most economists reckon they will not exceed 0.5%. The BoJ will also continue to buy “broadly the same amount” of government bonds to control long-term rates. Normalisation of its own balance-sheet will be a gradual process. “The BoJ has left a huge footprint on the market,” says Kato Izuru of Totan Research, a think-tank. “They want to reduce that footprint, but it cannot be reduced suddenly.”

随着BoJ步入新时代，一些风险潜伏。一个风险来自海外。如果美国或中国这两个最大的贸易伙伴出现经济放缓，将会对外部需求造成打压，并拖累日本企业前景，降低它们投资的可能性。

As the BoJ enters its new era, several risks loom. One comes from overseas. If there is a slowdown in America or China, Japan’s two biggest trading partners, it would weigh on external demand and drag down the outlook for Japanese firms, making them less likely to invest.

另一个风险来自国内。长期来看，日本庞大的政府债务利息支出将上升，给公共财政带来压力。金融系统看起来是健康的，但日本金融监管机构最近加强了对地区银行的监管。许多观察人士担心加息对抵押贷款和没有大量现金储备的中小企业的影响。

Another comes from within. In the long run, interest payments on Japan’s large government debt will rise, putting pressure on public finances. The financial system looks sound, but Japan’s financial regulator recently stepped up oversight of regional lenders. Many observers are concerned about the impact of rate rises on mortgages and small and medium-sized businesses that do not have large cash buffers.

最令人担忧的是通胀可能再次低于目标。物价通胀虽然仍高于2%，但已开始下降。两名持鸽派观点的董事反对废除负利率政策的决定，他们认为需要更多时间来确保通胀稳固。如果这一趋势持续下去，日本需要通过提高生产率和增加潜在增长率来进行改革，中根宏指出。如果从日本货币政策实验时代中得到的一个教训，那就是中央银行的权力是有限的。在日本的新时代，其他人将不得不发挥领导作用。■

Most worrying, inflation could drop below target again. Price inflation, while still above 2%, is already falling. Two doveish board members voted against the decision to abolish negative interest rates, arguing that more time was needed to be sure that inflation will stick. For the trend to continue, Japan needs reforms that raise productivity and boost the potential growth rate, Mr Nakaso argues. If there is one lesson from Japan’s era of monetary-policy experiments, it is that there are limits to central banks’ powers. During Japan’s new era, others will have to take the lead. ■

为什么美国无法摆脱通胀忧虑 (Why America can’t escape inflation worries)
=======================================================

尽管情况不确定，美联储仍然坚持其计划。 (The Federal Reserve sticks to its plans, despite an uncertain situation)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Jerome Powell announces that interest rates will not change during a press conference at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC, March 20th 2024 ](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FNP504.jpg)

杰罗姆·鲍威尔在2024年3月20日在华盛顿特区联邦储备委员会举行的新闻发布会上宣布，利率将不会改变。

Some hikers believe that the last mile is the hardest: all the blisters and accumulated aches slow progress at the very end. Others swear that it is the easiest because the finishing line is in sight. For the Federal Reserve, the last mile of its trek to bring inflation back to its 2% target has been simultaneously easy and hard. Easy in the sense that the central bank has not budged on interest rates for eight months, instead letting its previous tightening do the work. Hard because the wait for inflation to recede has felt rather long.

一些徒步者认为最后一英里是最艰难的：所有的水泡和积累的疼痛会在最后放慢前进的步伐。而另一些人则宣称这是最容易的，因为终点已经在眼前。对于美联储来说，将通货膨胀率带回2%目标的最后一英里既容易又困难。容易在于央行已经连续八个月未动过利率，而是让之前的收紧政策起作用。困难在于等待通货膨胀回落的时间感觉相当长。

The slow easing of price pressures and America’s continued economic vigour have fuelled debate about whether the Fed might chart a more aggressive course for the last mile of its anti-inflation journey. Policymakers had telegraphed that they would make three quarter-point rate cuts this year. But since then some prominent measures of inflation have seemingly got stuck at around 3-4%, while the unemployment rate has remained below 4%. So the big question heading into a monetary-policy meeting that concluded on March 20th was whether the Fed might pare its projection to two cuts. In the end, the central bank (or, to be a little more precise, the median voting member of its rate-setting committee) opted to maintain its outlook for three cuts in 2024, though it lowered its projection for 2025 from four cuts to three.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FNC014.png)

通胀压力缓慢放缓和美国持续的经济活力引发了一场关于美联储是否会在反通膨旅程的最后一英里采取更激进方针的讨论。决策者们曾预示他们将在今年进行三次四分之一百分点的利率降息。但自那时以来，一些重要的通胀指标似乎停滞在3-4%左右，同时失业率仍然低于4%。因此，走向3月20日结束的货币政策会议时的重要问题是，美联储是否会将其对今年的降息预期减少到两次。最终，中央银行（或者稍微准确地说，其利率制定委员会的中位投票成员）选择维持其对2024年进行三次降息的展望，尽管将2025年的预测从四次降至三次。

An important gap in inflation measures helps explain the Fed’s rationale for sticking with its plan for this year. Much of the concern about the persistence of inflation stems from recent readings of the consumer price index. “Core” CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, decelerated throughout much of 2022 and early 2023, but since last June has picked up speed. In both January and February it rose at a monthly clip of roughly 0.4%, a rate which, if sustained for a full year, would lead to annual inflation of about 5%—far too high for comfort for the Fed. In such a scenario America’s central bankers would be fretting not about cutting rates but about whether to resume raising them.

通胀指标方面的重要差距有助于解释美联储坚持今年计划的理由。对通货膨胀持续性的担忧主要来自最新的消费价格指数读数。“核心”消费价格指数剥离了波动较大的食品和能源成本，从2022年初至2023年初一直在放缓，但自去年六月以来加速上涨。在一月和二月，它的月度增长率分别达到了约0.4%，如果此速度持续一整年，将导致年通胀率约为5%，对美联储而言远高于舒适水平。在这种情况下，美国的中央银行家们将不会担心降息，而是担心是否恢复加息。

Yet whereas investors and commentators tend to emphasise the CPI, in no small part because it is the first inflation data point each month, the central bank’s focus is a separate gauge: the price index for personal consumption expenditures, which comes out several weeks later. Core PCE prices have been better behaved. Although they heated up in January, their annualised pace over the past half-year has been smack in line with the Fed’s 2% inflation target. This has helped give central bankers the confidence that they can start trimming rates relatively soon.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FNC879.png)

然而，虽然投资者和评论员往往强调消费价格指数，很大程度上是因为它是每月的首个通货膨胀数据点，但央行关注的是另一个尺度：个人消费支出价格指数，该指数在几周后公布。核心PCE价格表现得更为稳健。尽管一月份曾出现过升温，但过去半年的年化增速完全符合美联储2%的通货膨胀目标。这帮助央行家们相信他们可以很快开始削减利率。

At a press conference after its meeting Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, studiously avoided giving any strong hints about when the central bank will make its first cut. But the market—as implied by the price of rate-hedging contracts—expects that it will get under way in June. And Mr Powell was generally satisfied with price trends. “We continue to make good progress in bringing inflation down,” he said.

在会议后的新闻发布会上，美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔刻意避免了对央行何时开始降息提供任何强烈暗示。但市场预期——根据套期保值合约价格来看——降息将于六月开始。鲍威尔对价格趋势普遍感到满意。他表示:“我们在将通货膨胀下降方面继续取得良好进展。”

What accounts for the CPI-PCE divergence? The CPI is more rigid, with its components adjusted annually; the PCE is in effect adjusted every month, reflecting, for example, whether consumers substitute cheaper apples for dearer oranges. Over time that leads to slightly lower PCE price growth. Different weightings have also had a big impact this year. Housing makes up about a third of the CPI basket but just 15% of the PCE one, and stubbornly high rents have kept the CPI elevated. There are other differences, too. For instance, airfares pushed up the CPI in February, based on prices for a fixed set of flight routes. The PCE, which considers distances actually flown, has been lower.

消费价格指数和个人消费支出价格指数之间的差异是什么原因？消费价格指数更为固定，其组成部分每年调整一次；个人消费支出价格指数实际上是每月调整一次，反映了例如消费者是否将更便宜的苹果替代较贵的橙子等情况。随着时间的推移，这导致个人消费支出价格增长略低。不同的权重今年也产生了很大影响。住房约占了CPI篮子的三分之一，但只占PCE篮子的15%，顽固的高租金保持了CPI的上涨。今年还有其他差异。例如，基于一组固定航线的价格，航空票价推高了CPI。而考虑到实际飞行距离的个人消费支出价格指数则较低。

Once inflation does come down, the Fed’s officials face another debate. In an ideal world central bankers would guide a full-employment, stable-inflation economy to what is known as the neutral rate of interest, the level at which monetary policy is neither expansionary nor contractionary. In reality, although there is no way of observing the neutral rate the Fed still tries to aim for it, with its policymakers writing down their estimates every quarter. Since 2019 their median projection has, in real terms, been 0.5% (ie, a Fed-funds rate of 2.5% and a PCE inflation rate of 2%).

一旦通货膨胀下降，美联储官员将面临另一个辩论。在理想的世界中，央行家们会将完全就业、通货膨胀稳定的经济引导到所谓的中性利率，即货币政策既不扩张也不收缩的水平。实际上，虽然中性利率无法观察，但美联储仍然力图朝这一目标迈进，其决策者们每季度都会记录他们的估计值。自2019年以来，他们对于实际中性利率的中位预测一直是0.5%（即联邦基金利率为2.5%，PCE通胀率为2%）。

That has changed, albeit pretty imperceptibly. Narrowly, the Fed’s new median projection for rates in the long run shifted up to 2.6%, implying a real neutral rate of 0.6%. This may sound like a puny, academic difference. But it lies at the core of central-bank thinking about post-pandemic growth, in particular whether officials believe that rates should be higher on an ongoing basis in order to avoid economic overheating, perhaps because of rising productivity or excessive government spending. They appear to be heading towards that view, though Mr Powell demurred on drawing any conclusions based on the upward creep in long-run rates. The Fed still has to travel the last mile in its fight against inflation. Even once the journey comes to an end, though, a difficult interest-rate question will remain. ■

尽管变化微不足道，但美联储对于长期利率的新中位预测上调至2.6%，暗示着实际中性利率为0.6%。这可能听起来像一个微不足道的学术差别。但这是央行对后疫情增长的核心思考，特别是官员们是否认为长期来看，为了避免经济过热（也许是由于生产率提高或政府支出过多）利率应该更高。他们似乎正在朝这个观点靠拢，尽管鲍威尔对长期利率的微小上涨避而不谈。美联储仍需在与通货膨胀作斗争中走完最后的一英里。即使旅程结束，一个困难的利率问题仍会存在。■

先是史蒂文•姆努钦入股纽约社区银行，现在又想要收购TikTok (First Steven Mnuchin bought into NYCB, now he wants TikTok)
=========================================================================================

他的野心究竟有多大？ (Is there any limit to his ambitions?)
----------------------------------------------

![史蒂文·姆努钦](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FNP002.jpg)

在华尔街做过时间的经历长久以来一直是通往美国财政部最高职位的捷径。在第一任财政部长亚历山大·汉密尔顿之前，他可夸耀的事迹之一就是参与建立了仍在运营的纽约银行。更近些年，稍显英雄主义不那么显著的是，罗伯特·鲁宾和汉克·保尔森都曾在高盛集团这家银行任职后出任高官。正如其名称所暗示的那样，“旋转门”也会将人们送回原点。鲁宾先生后来担任花旗集团等其他银行的高级职位。 Cerberus Capital Management和Warburg Pincus这两家投资公司的主席分别是John Snow和Timothy Geithner。

Time served on Wall Street has long smoothed the path to the top job at America’s Treasury. Before he was the first treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton could boast, among other things, a role in establishing the Bank of New York, which is still in business. More recently, and somewhat less heroically, Robert Rubin and Hank Paulson both ran Goldman Sachs, a bank, before taking office. As its name suggests, the “revolving door” sends people in the other direction, too. Mr Rubin went on to hold senior positions at Citigroup, another bank. Cerberus Capital Management and Warburg Pincus, two investment firms, are chaired by John Snow and Timothy Geithner respectively.

现在，前高盛合伙人、曾在唐纳德·特朗普总统任内担任财政部长的史蒂文·姆努钦再次引起了公众的关注。他于2021年成立了Liberty Strategic Capital，一家投资公司。Liberty筹集的大部分资金来自中东的主权财富基金，这让一些人感到惊讶。直到最近，该公司的投资还没有引起关注。但就在这个月，由于与该行的房地产贷款有关的损失导致其股价大跌，Liberty领导了纽约社区银行（NYCB）的资本增长。该交易于3月11日结束。三天后，姆努钦告诉CNBC，他正在尝试收购TikTok，此前美国众议院通过了一项法案，要求其中国所有者字节跳动出售这款社交媒体应用，否则将在美国面临禁令。

Now Steven Mnuchin, a former partner at Goldman Sachs who served as treasury secretary throughout the presidency of Donald Trump, has leapt back into the limelight. In 2021 he set up Liberty Strategic Capital, an investment firm. That much of the cash raised by Liberty came from sovereign-wealth funds in the Middle East raised some eyebrows. Until recently, the firm’s investments did not. But this month Liberty led the capital raise by New York Community Bank (NYCB) after losses relating to the bank’s property loans caused its shares to tank. That deal closed on March 11th. Three days later Mr Mnuchin told CNBC that he was trying to buy TikTok after America’s House of Representatives passed a bill that would force its Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the social-media app or face a ban in America.

在这一系列备受关注的交易活动之前，该公司主要投资于私人网络安全公司。其中一些投资看起来不尽如人意。2021年，Liberty对Cybereason进行了2亿美元的投资，对该公司估值27亿美元。根据数据提供商PitchBook的数据，Cybereason在2023年的下一次资本增长交易中的估值仅为5.75亿美元。2022年初，Liberty对Satellogic进行了1.5亿美元的投资，当该公司与一家特殊目的收购公司合并上市时。如今，Satellogic的股票价值不到姆努钦公司支付的价格的四分之一。

Before this flurry of high-profile dealmaking, the firm mainly invested in privately held cyber-security firms. Some of its bets look like duds. In 2021 Liberty invested $200m in Cybereason, valuing the firm at $2.7bn. After plans to list its shares were shelved, Cybereason’s next capital raise in 2023 implied a valuation of just $575m, according to PitchBook, a data provider. At the beginning of 2022 Liberty invested $150m in Satellogic when the firm merged with a special-purpose acquisition company to list its shares. Today shares in Satellogic are worth less than a quarter of what Mr Mnuchin’s firm paid for them.

姆努钦在银行投资方面有经验。2009年，他领导了一群投资者购买了IndyMac，这是全球金融危机的受害者之一，然后于2015年卸任。作为纽约社区银行10亿美元的资本增长的一部分，曾在特朗普政府任职、负责银行监督的高级财政部官员约瑟夫·奥廷被任命为该公司的首席执行官。与此同时，Liberty出资4.5亿美元。尽管这笔交易增强了NYCB的资本，清理其贷款组合将需要更长时间。投资者信心在此过程中能否持续下去尚待观察——事实上，本周该行的股价在另一家银行Raymond James的分析师对NYCB的扭亏速度表示怀疑后下跌了7%。

Mr Mnuchin has experience of investing in banking. In 2009 he led a group of investors that purchased IndyMac, a casualty of the global financial crisis, before offloading it in 2015. As part of nycb’s $1bn capital raise, Joseph Otting, who served as a senior Treasury official responsible for bank supervision during the Trump administration, has been appointed as the firm’s chief executive. Meanwhile, Liberty stumped up $450m of the cash. Although the deal bolsters NYCB’s capital, cleaning up its loan portfolio will take longer. The extent to which investors’ confidence holds up while this happens remains to be seen—indeed, this week the bank’s shares fell by 7% after analysts at Raymond James, yet another bank, expressed doubts about the speed of NYCB’s turnaround.

但管理一家陷入困境的地区银行相比策划TikTok的收购就显得轻松多了。姆努钦并没有透露在他的财团中会有谁，只是表示该财团将由美国企业控制，并且没有任何单一投资者应拥有超过10%的股份。寻找资金很可能是执行这笔交易中最简单的部分。民主党可能会对私募基金的参与感到震惊。任何涉及科技公司的角色可能会引发反垄断的担忧。甚至一个故意保持中立的财团，也许包括沃尔玛这样的超市和甲骨文这样的软件公司，这两家公司在2020年差一点达成了交易，都可能发现中国政府正在阻碍这笔交易的进行。

But managing a struggling regional bank is light work compared with engineering a buy-out of TikTok. Mr Mnuchin has not said who would feature in his consortium, only that it would be controlled by American businesses, and that no single investor should own more than 10%. Finding the money would surely be the most straightforward part of executing the deal. Democrats may balk at the involvement of private-equity funds. Any role for technology firms could raise antitrust concerns. Even an intentionally inoffensive squad—perhaps including Walmart, a supermarket, and Oracle, a software firm, which came close to striking a deal in 2020—would probably find the Chinese government standing in the way of a sale.

姆努钦的背景也可能成为一种不适。作为财政部长，他曾主持美国外国投资委员会，这是监督国内外投资的美国机构，在特朗普先生早前试图强迫TikTok剥离的行动中发挥了关键作用。对一些人来说，他收购这款社交媒体应用将代表着“旋转门”制度的一切不合理。而对于那些乐意继续使用TikTok的人来说，这只是无伤大雅而已。■

Mr Mnuchin’s background could also become a source of discomfort. As treasury secretary, he chaired the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the country’s watchdog screening inbound investment, playing a crucial role in an earlier attempt by Mr Trump to force the divestment of TikTok. To some his acquisition of the social-media app would represent everything wrong with the revolving door. Others, especially those happy to keep using TikTok, would see it as mere swings and roundabouts. ■

如何交易选举 (How to trade an election)
==============================

投资者越来越难忽视政治 (It is becoming harder for investors to ignore politics)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

![插图：一个投票箱掉在一个存钱罐上。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FND002.jpg)

投资者在对待选举的态度上存在差异。一些人将政治视为可以利用的优势；另一些人则认为是需要屏蔽的噪音。即使对于没有财务利益的人来说，市场也以残酷直率的视角展示了经济利益的重要性。随着美国和英国以及其他许多国家的选举临近，这一点尤为重要。

Investors differ in their approach to elections. Some see politics as an edge to exploit; others as noise to block out. Even for those without a financial interest, markets offer a brutally frank perspective on the economic stakes. As elections approach in America and Britain, as well as plenty of other countries, that is especially valuable.

让我们来看看2020年美国总统选举之前和之后发生的事情。随着乔·拜登获胜的可能性增加，绿色能源和大麻股票曾一度成为市场宠儿，因为投资者预计他的政府将出台有利于这两个行业的政策。从选举前两个月到拜登就任总统，覆盖这些领域的交易所交易基金上涨了超过100％，然后随着投资者减少乐观情绪而下跌。

Take what happened before and after America’s presidential election in 2020. Green-energy and cannabis stocks briefly became market darlings as the odds of a victory for Joe Biden rose, since investors expected his administration to enact policies favourable to both. Exchange-traded funds covering the sectors rallied by over 100% from two months before the election to Mr Biden’s inauguration, before later dropping as investors scaled back their optimism.

市场如何看待当前的白宫竞选？候选人的议程在某些方面是相似的。两者都倾向于保护主义（尽管特朗普的计划更为激进）；两者都将直面巨额赤字（尽管受益者不同）。但也存在很大的差异。特朗普曾发誓结束欧洲对美国国防预算的躺赢；拜登不太可能延长特朗普首个任期于2025年到期的减税措施。特朗普将削减拜登的通货膨胀削减法案（IRA），将绿色支出转向化石燃料。拜登将墨西哥视为一片“友好海岸”；特朗普则将其视为一个危险人物。

What are markets saying about the current race for the White House? The candidates’ agendas are similar in places. Both tilt protectionist (though Mr Trump’s plans are more radical); both would oversee hefty deficits (though with different beneficiaries). But there are also big differences. Mr Trump has vowed to end Europe’s freeriding on America’s defence budget; Mr Biden is unlikely to renew tax cuts from Mr Trump’s first term that expire in 2025. Mr Trump would gut Mr Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), redirecting green spending to fossil fuels. Mr Biden sees Mexico as somewhere to “friendshore”; Mr Trump sees it as a bogeyman.

这意味着一些上市公司将受益，而其他公司则有可能面临损失。较高的欧洲军事支出将提振欧洲的国防企业。如果特朗普撤销IRA，太阳能供应商和电动汽车制造商将受损，而煤电厂的所有者则会比较高兴。如果选举结果接近，支持失败候选人的人引发骚乱，建筑玻璃公司的股价将表现良好。

This means that some listed firms stand to win, while others look likely to lose out. Higher European military spending would boost the continent’s defence firms. If Mr Trump were to roll back the IRA, solar-power providers and electric-car makers would be hurt, while owners of coal plants would be rather happier. If the vote is close, and supporters of the losing candidate riot, shares in architectural-glass firms should do well.

投机者可以根据情况调整投资以押注选举结果。事实上，一揽子公司股票组合，应当会在特朗普获胜时受益，并在这种情况下押注会输的公司的空头头寸，可以跟踪特朗普在各种投注市场中赢得选举的几率。下面的图表展示了一种此类投资组合，由研究公司Citrini Research编制。

Speculators can bet on the outcome of the election by investing money accordingly. Indeed, a portfolio of company stocks that ought to benefit if Mr Trump wins, as well as short positions on companies that ought to lose out in such a scenario, tracks Mr Trump’s odds of winning the election in betting markets. The chart below shows one such basket, assembled by Citrini Research, a research firm.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FNC898.png)

那么对于更广泛的资产类别，会有什么后果呢？过去，那些希望避开政治的投资者可以通过持有多样化投资组合来保护自己。毕竟，在运转良好的民主国家，政治很少影响整体股市回报、主权债券或货币。摩根大通，一家银行，在评估美国过去的总统选举时发现，选举结果与随后的整体股市表现之间没有明显关系。

What about the consequences for broader asset classes? Investors who would prefer to avoid politics used to be able to shield themselves by simply holding a diversified portfolio. After all, in well-functioning democracies, politics rarely affected overall stockmarket returns, sovereign bonds or currencies. When assessing past American presidential elections, JPMorgan Chase, a bank, finds there is no clear relationship between the outcome and subsequent overall stockmarket performance.

然而，忽视政治正变得更加困难。试想一下，在忽略英国脱欧谈判或2022年像莉兹·特拉斯一样担任短暂总理职务的政策的情况下交易英国市场的人该多么可怜。选举还会推动新兴市场的变化，这就是为什么脱欧在英国引发了半开玩笑的担忧，认为英国已经成为了一个新兴市场。直到公投之前，政治风险衡量指标与期权衡量的英镑隐含波动率之间几乎没有关系，后者捕捉了对冲货币波动成本的程度。从那时起，这两者之间开始密切相关。

Avoiding politics is becoming more difficult, however. Pity anyone trading British markets while ignoring Brexit negotiations or the policies of Liz Truss, who was prime minister for the life of a lettuce in 2022. Elections also drive moves in emerging markets, which is why Brexit prompted half-joking concerns that Britain had become one. Until the run-up to the referendum there was virtually no relationship between gauges of political risk and the implied volatility of sterling as measured by options, which captures how much hedging currency moves costs. Since then, the two have tracked one another closely.

然而，英国的经验并非一个特例，而是可能预示着全球性的趋势。对于国家支出的热情现在已经非常普遍，财政过度支出可能产生重大且无法预见的后果。例如，2021年民主党在美国佐治亚州参议院选举中险胜，释放了一系列刺激措施。例如，当天，国债收益率上升了0.1个百分点——这是一个很大的变动，但并非不寻常。现在看来，明显可以看出财政慷慨放大了通货膨胀，这意味着更大的波动是合理的。

Yet rather than being an outlier, Britain’s experience may presage a global trend. Enthusiasm for state spending is now widespread, and fiscal excess can have large and unforeseeable consequences. The Democrats’ knife-edge win in the Georgia US senate election in 2021 unlocked a bevy of stimulus, for instance. Treasury yields rose by 0.1 percentage points that day—a big move but not an unusual one. With hindsight, it is clear that fiscal largesse amplified inflation, meaning an even larger move would have been justified.

此外，政治不仅对市场更为重要；其影响也变得更不可预测。让许多投资者担忧的一个场景是：特朗普是否会兑现他取代美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔的威胁。债券收益率会因预期货币政策放松而下降，还是会因为出现类似特拉斯风格的“笨蛋风险溢价”而上升？答案远非明显。这一点的重要性再清楚不过了。 ■

Moreover, politics does not only matter more for markets; its effects are also becoming less predictable. Take a scenario troubling many investors today: that Mr Trump carries out his threat to replace Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman. Would bond yields fall on expectations of looser monetary policy, or rise as a Ms-Truss-style “moron risk premium” became baked in? The answer is far from obvious. Its importance could not be any clearer.■

美国的房地产经纪人操纵仍然存在 (America’s realtor racket is alive and kicking)
============================================================

经纪人和业主之间的和解庆祝过早了 (Celebrations over a settlement between agents and homeowners are premature)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![美国麻萨诸塞州威斯特伍德的一栋房子前面竖立着一个"待售"标志](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FNP503.jpg)

五年来，房主们一直在进行抗争。他们一直在抨击在美国被称为“**房地产经纪人**”的房地产经纪人收取的价格昂贵的费用，这些费用是通过反竞争的做法强制执行的。他们对经纪人提起诉讼；与全国房地产经纪人协会（**NAR**）进行法律纠纷；起诉房屋待售信息数据库的保管人，被称为“**多房源服务**”。全国各地的陪审团和法官已经认定他们的主张有理，裁定房主被敲诈，被操纵并被欺骗以支付过高的费用。最近几个月，他们向原告授予了数十亿美元，并让双方就控制房地产经纪人实践规则的谈判。

For five years homeowners have been waging war. They have railed against the extortionate fees charged by estate agents, known as “realtors” in America, which are enforced by anticompetitive practices. They have filed lawsuits against brokers; fought cases against the National Association of Realtors (nar), an industry body; and sued the keepers of databases of homes for sale, known as “multiple-listing services”. Juries and judges across the country have found merit in their claims, deciding that homeowners have been ripped off, manipulated and duped into overpaying. In recent months they have awarded billions of dollars to plaintiffs and sent the two sides into negotiations over the rules that control realtors’ practices.

如果能够相信，**三月十五日**达成的一项和解协议，是几个集体诉讼的原告与NAR之间达成的，将迎来一个更加公平、更便宜的时代，那该有多好。这是*纽约时报*的描述该协议方式，*纽约时报*在揭露达成协议后，头条大标题是“强大的房地产经纪团体同意削减佣金以解决诉讼”。CNN写道，该和解将“有效地摧毁”该行业的反竞争规则。甚至白宫也抓住了现在胜利已经确凿的观念，希望在**十一月的总统选举**前获得任何有关房屋价格可负担性的好消息。**三月十九日**，乔·拜登总统宣布，这项和解是“提高住房市场竞争的重要一步”，并表示可能会将交易成本降低“高达每笔中位数房屋销售的**$10,000**”。

How wonderful it would be to believe that a settlement reached on March 15th, between the plaintiffs in several class-action lawsuits and the NAR, was about to usher in a fairer, cheaper era. That is how the agreement was described by the *New York Times*, which plastered the headline “Powerful realtor group agrees to slash commissions to settle lawsuits” across its scoop revealing that the agreement had been reached. CNN wrote that the settlement would “effectively destroy” the industry’s anticompetitive rules. The notion that victory is now assured has even been seized upon by the White House, which is desperate for any kernel of good news about housing affordability ahead of the presidential election in November. On March 19th President Joe Biden declared that the settlement was “an important step toward boosting competition in the housing market”, adding that it could reduce transaction costs by “as much as $10,000 on the median home sale.”

然而，目前仍不清楚这项和解是否真的会带来更大的竞争和更低的佣金。而现在接受这样的和解是风险太大了，因为它还会保护经纪人免受未来可能寻求更多改革的诉讼。根据现有系统，美国人几乎在每笔交易中支付**5-6%**的佣金，是其他富裕国家的三倍。由于他们每年交易的房屋总价值高达**2.8万亿美元**，如果佣金降至只有**2%**，美国人每年可以节省**1100亿美元**的费用。

It is not at all clear, however, that this settlement will actually bring about a Utopia of greater competition and lower commissions. And the stakes are too high to accept such a settlement, which also protects brokers and agents from future lawsuits that might seek more reform. Under the existing system Americans pay 5-6% commission on almost every sale, triple the level in other rich countries. Since they trade homes collectively worth $2.8trn each year, if commissions fell to just 2% Americans would save $110bn in fees annually.

问题核心在于一种叫做“**引导**”的策略。在美国，一个卖方会合理预期地向任何给他带来买家的房地产经纪人提供报酬。往往是提议平均分佣金：如果总报酬是**6%**，卖方经纪人和买方的经纪人各收到**3%**。问题在于，尽管卖方可以与自己的经纪人协商并降低他们这方面的成交额，但如果他们试图向买方的经纪人提供少量佣金，他们会被告知——正确地——他们的房屋会吸引更少的兴趣，没有合适的报价。

The problem boils down to a tactic called “steering”. In America it is both legal and expected that a home seller will make a blanket offer of compensation to any realtor who brings them a buyer. Often this is a proposal to split commission equally: if the total compensation is 6%, the seller’s agent and the agent of the buyer will each receive 3%. The problem is that although sellers can negotiate with their own agent and drive down that side of the bargain, if they attempt to offer a low commission to a buyer’s agent they will be told—correctly—that their home will get less interest and no decent offers.

并非必须认为房地产经纪人在道义上破产，才能看到这种系统如何不断延续。即使只有，比如说，**10%**的经纪人可能会让买家远离低佣金的房源，这就足以确保所有有声望的经纪人受益，因为卖方提供**3%**以确保自己不吃亏。这就使得总佣金有了一个底线。

It is not necessary to believe that realtors are morally bankrupt in order to see how this system perpetuates itself. The risk that even, say, 10% of agents might steer buyers away from a low-commission listing is enough to ensure that all the honourable ones benefit, since sellers offer 3% to ensure they do not lose out. This enforces a floor in total commissions.

该和解需要法官批准后，将于**七月**实施，但对于解决这个潜在问题做得太少。其主要规定之一是，**买方经纪人报酬的提议**不能再在房地产业使用的数据库**多房源服务**上发布。但它们仍然可以制定，并且可以在网站上发布，或透过文本或电话解释。在Facebook群组和Reddit主题中，房地产经纪人已经在讨论这样的**变通方法**。

The settlement, which needs to be approved by a judge before being implemented in July, does little to tackle this underlying problem. One of its main provisions is that offers of buyer-agent compensation can no longer be published on a multiple-listing service, the databases used in the industry. But they can still be made, and can be published on websites or explained via text or a phone call. In Facebook groups and Reddit threads, realtors are already discussing such workarounds.

另一项规定是，在雇佣经纪人服务之前，买方必须签署一份协议，详细说明经纪人将如何获取报酬。目前，买方几乎从不讨论，甚至往往不知道他们的经纪人赚多少钱。他们只知道这不是他们的问题，因为费用由卖方支付。

Another provision is that, before employing an agent’s services, buyers must sign an agreement outlining how the agent will be paid. At present buyers almost never discuss, and often do not even know, how much money their agent is making. They just know it is not their problem, since the fee is covered by the seller.

这个规定可能对**买方经纪人的低限**产生影响。如果要求经纪人告知买方他们打算收取销售价格**3%**，并且——在卖方不提供报酬的情况下——买方将为此负责，那资金紧张的买家可能会寻求更便宜的选择。他们还可能拒绝认为他们的经纪人值**3%**，并要求购买后将超过一定水平的任何补偿**比如 1%**退还给他们。

It is just about possible to see how this provision could erode the floor in buyer-agent compensation. If agents are required to tell buyers they intend to collect 3% of the sale price, and that—in the unlikely event a seller is not offering compensation—the buyer will be on the hook for it, cash-strapped buyers might seek a cheaper option instead. They might also reject the idea that their agent is worth 3%, and could argue for any compensation above a certain level, perhaps 1%, to be kicked back to them after the purchase.

然而，这可能假设了买方对经纪人的精明，以及对经纪人的聪明。房地产经纪人可能简单地同意在任何合同上增加条款，向买方保证在卖方提供低佣金的情况下不向他们要求现金，然后将他们远离这类房产，行业分析师Rob Hahn指出。

Yet this probably assumes too much savvy on the behalf of buyers, and too little ingenuity from agents. Realtors might simply agree to add a clause to any contract reassuring buyers that they will not go after them for cash in the event a seller offers low commission, before steering them away from such properties, notes Rob Hahn, an industry analyst.

司法部（DoJ）可能会干预。在马萨诸塞州的一起案件中，司法部称，该协议不会解决引导问题，因此这并不够。由拜登政府任命的官员受制于特朗普政府发出的一封信，同意结束对该行业的调查。当现任司法部试图重新调查时，NAR起诉了该部门，称其不应食言早前的承诺。但这个听取此案的特区哥伦比亚法院对NAR的论点表现出怀疑，这可能为司法部采取行动铺平了道路。

The Department of Justice (DoJ) could intervene. It did so in a case in Massachusetts, arguing that the agreement would not fix the problem of steering and was therefore insufficient. Officials appointed by the Biden administration have been constrained by a letter sent by those in the Trump one, which agreed to close a probe into the industry. When the current DoJ attempted to reopen it, the department was sued by the NAR, which argued it should not renege on the earlier promise. But an appeals court in the District of Columbia hearing this case sounded sceptical of the NAR’s arguments. That could pave the way for the DoJ to make a move.

无论是取消目前的和解还是展开自己的调查，司法部都明智地采取行动。在目前的方式下，美国的房屋买卖双方无法为佣金支付公平价格。而目前达成的和解也无法保证他们在未来会有这样的机会。■

Whether by killing the current settlement or opening its own probe, the doj would be wise to act. Homebuyers and sellers in America do not stand a chance of paying a fair price for commissions under the current approach. And the settlement as agreed offers no guarantee that they will have such a chance in the future. ■

《奇经异谭》为何未能改变经济学 (Why “Freakonomics” failed to transform economics)
===============================================================

这种方法很有趣，但已经不受青睐。 (The approach was fun, but has fallen out of favour)
------------------------------------------------------------------

![Illustration of a maths equation featuring a gun, a burning cross and a sumo wrestler](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_FND000.jpg)

“**经济学**是关于人类在日常生活中的一门研究。”这是阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔在19世纪的教科书《经济学原理》中的开篇语句，这本教科书帮助创建了今天经济学家们仍在使用的共同语言。马歇尔认为经济学研究“日常生活”并非是挖苦，而是决心的表述。这门学科认真对待人类生活中最紧迫的问题之一。我如何支付账单？我应该从事什么职业？如果病倒了会发生什么？我是否会有退休的一天？

“Economics is a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.” So starts Alfred Marshall’s “Principles of Economics”, a 19th-century textbook that helped create the common language economists still use today. Marshall’s contention that economics studies the “ordinary” was not a dig, but a statement of intent. The discipline was to take seriously some of the most urgent questions in human life. How do I pay my bills? What do I do for a living? What happens if I get sick? Will I ever be able to retire?

2003年，《纽约时报》刊登了对芝加哥大学经济学家史蒂文·列维特的专访，在该文中他表达了一种截然不同的观点：“在列维特看来”，文章写道，“**经济学**是一门具有出色工具获取答案的科学，但却严重缺乏有趣问题。” 列维特和作者斯蒂芬·达布纳随后一同撰写了《**奇怪的经济学**》。在他们的书中，几乎没有关于日常生活的东西。书中通过作弊的相扑选手、挣最低工资的毒贩以及美国白人优越主义组织——三K党，来探讨人们如何响应激励以及如何利用新颖数据揭示驱动他们行为的真正因素。

In 2003 the *New York Times* published a profile of Steven Levitt, an economist at the University of Chicago, in which he expressed a very different perspective: “In Levitt’s view,” the article read, “economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions.” Mr Levitt and the article’s author, Stephen Dubner, would go on to write “Freakonomics” together. In their book there was little about the ordinary business of life. Through vignettes featuring cheating sumo wrestlers, minimum-wage-earning crack dealers and the Ku Klux Klan, a white-supremacist organisation, the authors explored how people respond to incentives and how the use of novel data can uncover what is really driving their behaviour.

《**奇怪的经济学**》大获成功，畅销书榜上仅次于哈利·波特。就像漫威漫画一样，它产生了一个扩展的宇宙:《纽约时报》专栏、播客、续集，以及模仿者和批评者，他们决心驳倒其论据。它处于一股承诺提供关于常规智慧忽略的事物的古怪且严谨分析的书籍浪潮的顶峰。3月7日，许多人心目中的经济学家形象的列维特宣布他从学术界退休。“这不适合我”，他说。

Freakonomics was a hit. It ranked just below Harry Potter in the bestseller lists. Much like Marvel comics, it spawned an expanded universe: *New York Times* columns, podcasts and sequels, as well as imitators and critics, determined to tear down its arguments. It was at the apex of a wave of books that promised a quirky—yet rigorous—analysis of things that the conventional wisdom had missed. On March 7th Mr Levitt, who for many people became the image of an economist, announced his retirement from academia. “It’s the wrong place for me to be,” he said.

在其学术生涯中，列维特撰写了有关应用微观经济学的论文。用他自嘲的话来说，他是“‘可信度革命’的一部分。” 这指的是利用统计技巧，如工具变量分析、自然实验和回归不连续，这些技巧旨在从数据中揭示因果关系。他推广了经济学家如大卫·卡德、吉多·因本斯和乔舒亚·安格里斯等人的技术，他们一起在2021年获得了经济学诺贝尔奖。其思想是利用数据中的怪事，以模拟实验中实际科学家发现的随机性。例如，可以利用学期的不确定性开始日期来估算教育年限延长对工资的影响。

During his academic career, Mr Levitt wrote papers in applied microeconomics. He was, in his own self-effacing words, “a footnote to the ‘credibility revolution’”. This refers to the use of statistical tricks, such as instrumental-variable analysis, natural experiments and regression discontinuity, which are designed to tease out causal relationships from data. He popularised the techniques of economists including David Card, Guido Imbens and Joshua Angrist, who together won the economics Nobel prize in 2021. The idea was to exploit quirks in the data to simulate the randomness that actual scientists find in controlled experiments. Arbitrary start dates for school terms could, for instance, be employed to estimate the effect of an extra year of education on wages.

《**奇怪的经济学**》的独特之处在于将这些技术应用于“万事万物的隐藏面”，正如书中的口号所说。列维特的工作主要关注犯罪、教育和种族歧视。该书最具争议的一章声称，1973年美国全国范围内的堕胎合法化导致了上世纪90年代犯罪率下降，因为有更多的不受欢迎的婴儿在长大成为不良少年之前被堕胎。那是典型的聪明人类风格：一位毫不退缩的社会科学家利用数据得出令人意外的结论，而且毫不畏避得罪。然而，这个结论是错误的。后来的研究者发现了编码错误，并指出列维特使用的是总逮捕人数，它取决于人口规模，而非逮捕率，而后者则不受人口规模的影响。其他人指出减少凶杀罪的开始是在妇女中出现的。无过错离婚而不是堕胎合法化，可能起到更大的作用。

Where the Freakonomics approach differed was to apply these techniques to “the hidden side of everything”, as the book’s tagline put it. Mr Levitt’s work focused on crime, education and racial discrimination. The book’s most controversial chapter argued that America’s nationwide legalisation of abortion in 1973 had led to a fall in crime in the 1990s, because more unwanted babies were aborted before they could grow into delinquent teenagers. It was a classic of the clever-dick genre: an unflinching social scientist using data to come to a counterintuitive conclusion, and not shying away from offence. It was, however, wrong. Later researchers found a coding error and pointed out that Mr Levitt had used the total number of arrests, which depends on the size of a population, and not the arrest rate, which does not. Others pointed out that the fall in homicide started among women. No-fault divorce, rather than legalised abortion, may have played a bigger role.

其他经济学家，包括列维特在芝加哥的同事、另一位诺贝尔奖获得者詹姆斯·赫克曼，担心这种独创会带来琐碎。他在一次采访中将该方法称为“可爱的”。比如，他写了一篇关于“最弱环节”中歧视的文章，这是一个游戏节目，在游戏的早期阶段，选手根据是否认为其他选手回答错问题会损失自己的金钱（在游戏的后期，他们是否会成为奖池的竞争对手而回答正确）来投票去除其他参与者。这提供了一个背景，让列维特可以研究别人的能力观察如何与种族主义和性别歧视相互作用。这是一个狡猾的设计，但或许在理解更广泛的经济结果方面具有有限的相关性。

Other economists, including James Heckman, Mr Levitt’s colleague in Chicago and another Nobel prizewinner, worried about trivialisation. “Cute”, was how he described the approach in one interview. Take a paper on discrimination in the “The Weakest Link”, a game show in which contestants vote to remove other contestants depending on whether they think they are costing them money by getting questions wrong (in the early portion of the game) or are competition for the prize pool by getting them right (later on). That provided a setting in which Mr Levitt could look at how observations of others’ competence interacted with racism and sexism. A cunning design—but perhaps of limited relevance in understanding broader economic outcomes.

赫克曼批评的核心是，这些研究的从业者注重“内部有效性”(确保某种变化的效应估计正确)而非“外部有效性”(估计是否更普遍适用). 赫克曼认为，经济学家应该建立决策制定的结构模型，并利用数据来估计解释其中行为的参数。这场辩论变得毒化。据列维特称，赫克曼甚至要求研究生分析《**奇怪的经济学**》作者的作品以作为期末考试题目。

At the heart of Mr Heckman’s critique was the idea that practitioners of such studies were focusing on “internal validity” (ensuring estimates of the effect of some change were correctly estimated) over “external validity” (whether the estimates would apply more generally). Mr Heckman instead thought that economists should create structural models of decision-making and use data to estimate the parameters that explained behaviour within them. The debate turned toxic. According to Mr Levitt, Mr Heckman went so far as to assign graduate students the task of tearing apart the Freakonomics author’s work for their final exam.

两人皆无胜负。可信度革命"吞噬了自己的孩子:后续的论文常常推翻结果，即使像《**奇怪的经济学**》那些研究成果，它们在之后依旧作为鸡尾酒派对的趣闻佳话。这一问题也蔓延到整个这个行业。美联储的经济学家最近的一项研究发现，他们检查的发表论文中不到一半能够复制，即使得到了原作者的帮助。列维特的反直觉结果已经过时，而总体上经济学家们变得更加怀疑。

Neither man won. The credibility revolution ate its own children: subsequent papers often overturned results, even if, as in the case of those popularised by Freakonomics, they had an afterlife as cocktail-party anecdotes. The problem has spread to the rest of the profession, too. A recent study by economists at the Federal Reserve found that less than half of the published papers they examined could be replicated, even when given help from the original authors. Mr Levitt’s counterintuitive results have fallen out of fashion and economists in general have become more sceptical.

然而，赫克曼青睐的方法也存在其自身的问题。结构模型需要假设，这些假设和任何古怪的准实验一样难以置信。可悲的是，当代研究大量使用数据和“可信度革命”的技术来得出显而易见的结论。经济学的古老问题一直像以前一样令人感兴趣。研究这些问题的工具仍需不断完善。■

Yet Mr Heckman’s favoured approaches have problems of their own. Structural models require assumptions that can be as implausible as any quirky quasi-experiment. Sadly, much contemporary research uses vast amounts of data and the techniques of the “credibility revolution” to come to obvious conclusions. The centuries-old questions of economics are as interesting as they always were. The tools to investigate them remain a work in progress. ■

埃隆·马斯克的星舰第三次尝试进入轨道 (Elon Musk’s Starship reaches orbit on its third attempt)
=========================================================================

虽然未能返回地球，但已更接近星辰。 (Though it failed to return to Earth, it’s a step nearer to the stars)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![SpaceX的下一代Starship宇宙飞船升空。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_STP002.jpg)

世界上最大的火箭再次飞行，3月14日的无人试飞，就像前两次一样，以“快速非计划拆解”（即灾难性爆炸）告终。但SpaceX建造的Starship上层火箭段首次到达轨道，并在被毁前完成了多项测试操作，这是埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）的火箭公司。在曾用名为Twitter的社交网络X上的一则挑衅性帖子中，马斯克先生坚称“Starship将使生活走向多星球”。也许。这次最新的飞行至少是朝着这个方向迈出的又一小步。

THE WORLD’s largest rocket has flown again, and its uncrewed test flight on March 14th, like the two previous ones, ended in “rapid unscheduled disassembly” (ie, catastrophic explosions). But the upper stage of Starship, built by SpaceX, Elon Musk’s rocket company, reached orbit for the first time and completed several test operations before being destroyed while re-entering Earth’s atmosphere. In [a defiant post on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1768287613570396165?s=20), the social network formerly known as Twitter, Mr Musk insisted that “Starship will make life multiplanetary.” Perhaps. This latest flight was at least another small step in that direction.

实际上，Starship分为两个部分：庞然大物的71米高、33台发动机的超级重型助推器段和50米高的Starship上层火箭段，后者在大约70公里（44英里）的高度阶段与助推器段分离，进入轨道。这辆组合飞行器的首次试飞是在2023年4月，起飞后大约四分钟后结束，整个飞行器自毁，因为阶段分离失败，火箭开始螺旋不稳。在去年11月的第二次试飞中，Starship上层火箭成功地在飞行三分钟后从助推器上分离，并继续飞行了另外八分钟，达到了149公里的高度。但是这两个部分随后都发生了导致快速非计划拆解的故障。

Starship is in fact two vehicles: the Super Heavy booster stage, a behemoth 71 metres tall with 33 engines, and the 50-metre Starship upper stage, which separates from the booster at an altitude of around 70km (44 miles) to proceed to orbit. The combined vehicle’s first test flight, in April 2023, ended roughly four minutes after lift-off, with the self-destruction of the entire spacecraft, after stage-separation failed and the rocket began to corkscrew erratically. During the second test flight, in November, the Starship upper stage successfully separated from the booster around three minutes into the flight, and continued to fly for another eight minutes, reaching an altitude of 149km. But both vehicles then suffered failures that led to their rapid unscheduled disassembly.

这第三次飞行，再次在SpaceX位于德克萨斯州博卡奇卡附近的Starbase进行，也导致了两个部分的损失。但这次上层火箭段达到了高度为230公里的轨道。SpaceX的目标是最终使两个部分完全可重复使用，像其Falcon 9助推器一样返回地球着陆。然而，在这些最初的试飞中，其计划是让超级重型助推器在海上进行“轻”式着陆，使用火箭引擎减速下降，然后滑入水中，而Starship则绕地球飞行一半，重新进入大气层，进行“硬”式着陆（即从高空坠入海中）。

The third flight, once again from SpaceX’s Starbase near Boca Chica in Texas, also led to the loss of both vehicles. But this time the upper stage reached orbit, at an altitude of 230km. SpaceX’s aim is that both vehicles should eventually be fully reusable, flying back to Earth to land, as its Falcon 9 boosters already do. For these initial test flights, however, its plan has been for the Super Heavy booster to practise a “soft” splashdown at sea, slowing its descent using rocket engines before slipping beneath the waves, while the Starship swoops halfway around the Earth, re-enters the atmosphere and makes a “hard” splashdown (ie, crashes into the sea from a great height).

然而，即使这些更有限的目标迄今也被证明是过于雄心勃勃。在去年11月的试飞中，超级重型助推器在试图重新点火准备水上着陆时发生爆炸。这一次，它成功完成了“再次推力燃烧”，使其抵达了墨西哥湾的预定着陆点。但当它重新点火进行着陆减速，使下降速度接近零时，出了问题，导致飞行器在水面上方数百米处爆炸。

Yet even these more limited goals have so far proved overambitious. During the test flight in November, the Super Heavy booster exploded when it attempted to reignite its engines in preparation for splashdown. This time round, it successfully completed its “boostback burn”, which carried it to its intended splashdown point in the Gulf of Mexico. But when it reignited its engines for its landing burn, to slow its descent velocity to almost zero, something went wrong, causing the vehicle to explode a few hundred metres above the water.

然而，Starship达到了绕地球低轨道，飞越了非洲南部。在这个所谓的“沿海阶段”，它进行了一系列测试操作：打开和关闭负载舱门（Starship最终将能携带高达150吨的负载进入轨道）；在两个内置油箱之间转移推进剂（为未来在轨道上进行的Starship对接加油做准备，这是前往月球和火星的任务的要求）；最后，尝试进行受控再入。机载摄像头显示出了预期的闪亮粉红色等离子体，表明了宇宙飞船重新进入大气层时的情况。

The Starship, however, reached a low-Earth orbit that took it across southern Africa. While in this so-called coast phase, it carried out a series of test operations: opening and closing its payload door (Starship will ultimately be able to carry as much as 150 tonnes of payload into orbit); transferring propellant between two on-board tanks (a warm-up for future Starship-to-Starship refuelling in orbit, a requirement for missions to the Moon and Mars); and, finally, attempting a controlled re-entry. On-board cameras showed the glowing pink plasma expected of a spacecraft re-entering the atmosphere.

但不久之后失去了联系，SpaceX宣布飞行器已经解体。（这是因为隔热瓦片的失效、对Starship失控还是其他原因导致的这一点仍然不清楚。）

But contact was lost soon afterwards, and SpaceX announced that the vehicle had disintegrated. (Whether this was because of a failure of its heat-shielding tiles, loss of control of the Starship or some other reason remains unclear.)

SpaceX因其试飞倾向以昂贵的烟花秀告终而受到嘲笑，但这种批评误解了公司在火箭发展方面的方法。它更喜欢快速迭代并从失败中学习，而不是费力地计划进行一次完美的发射，而在火箭行业中，完美发射几乎永远不会发生（正如日本公司Space One的Kairos火箭在3月13日的首次飞行中失败所显示的）。对于像Starship这样的复杂系统，成功的首次飞行尤为不可能，它是有史以来最大的火箭，旨在将人类送往其他星球。在发射前的一份声明中，SpaceX表示，每次飞行测试仍然只是一次测试。尽管它们可能不是在实验室中进行的，公司补充道，但无论如何都是为了获取信息。

SpaceX has been mocked for the tendency of its test flights to end in expensive firework shows, but such criticism misunderstands the company’s approach to rocket development. It prefers to iterate quickly and learn from failure, rather than painstakingly plan for a perfect launch—which, in the rocket industry, almost never happens (as the loss of the Kairos rocket launched by Space One, a Japanese firm, on its inaugural flight on March 13th, demonstrated). And a successful maiden flight is particularly unlikely for a system as complex as Starship, the largest rocket ever built, which is intended to carry humans to other worlds. In a statement before the launch, SpaceX said that each of these flight tests continues to be just that: a test. They may not be occurring in a lab, the company added, but are about getting information nonetheless.

这种不太风险回避的方法无疑使SpaceX在这一行业中超越了其竞争对手；去年，其Falcon 9火箭完成的任务和送入轨道的负载量均超过了任何其他公司或太空机构。对SpaceX更具有说服力的批评是，其在环境保护等领域存在取巧行为。Starbase设施周围环绕着内格罗大河谷国家野生动物保护区，这里栖息着濒临灭绝的美洲豹和濒危的灰鹤等物种。去年4月的第一次Starship试飞导致了其发射平台的严重破坏，将碎片散布在一大片区域内，促使监管火箭发射的美国联邦航空局进行了安全审查。SpaceX随后对其发射平台进行了升级，安装了一个“火焰偏导器”系统，在火箭起飞时向底部喷水，以减少噪音、热量和损坏。但环保人士仍然担心其活动对环境的影响。

This less risk-averse approach has undoubtedly enabled SpaceX to outpace its rivals in the industry; last year its Falcon 9 rockets flew more missions and launched more mass into orbit than did those of any other company or space agency. A more valid criticism of SpaceX is that it has cut corners in areas such as environmental protection. The Starbase facility is surrounded by the Lower Rio Grande Valley national wildlife refuge, which is home to an endangered species of ocelot, and the piping plover, a threatened bird species, among other things. The first Starship test flight, last April, caused extensive damage to its launching pad, scattering debris over a wide area, and prompting the Federal Aviation Authority, which regulates rocket launches, to conduct a safety review. SpaceX has since upgraded its launching pad with a “flame deflector” system that sprays water beneath the rocket as it takes off, to reduce noise, heat and damage. But environmentalists continue to worry about the impact of its activities.

而尽管SpaceX以太空行业标准而言取得了快速进展，Starship的开发却比预期的时间长。该工作部分由美国国家航空航天局（NASA）资助，对其计划在本十年晚些时候将人类送回月球至关重要。作为“阿尔忒弥斯”计划的一部分，原计划于2025年在Starship飞行器上降落月球的宇航员，已将提前到2026年。但考虑到Starship尚未成功飞行，更不用说有人搭乘了，这一目标看起来也很困难。

And while SpaceX may be making rapid progress by spacefaring standards, Starship development is taking longer than expected. The work is partly funded by NASA, America’s space agency, and is critical to its plans to return humans to the Moon later this decade. A lunar landing by astronauts in a Starship vehicle, as part of the Artemis programme, once planned for 2025, has been delayed to 2026. And even that looks a stretch given that Starship has yet to fly successfully, let alone with humans on board.

马斯克表示他希望Starship“今年至少再进行六次飞行”。即使考虑到他臭名昭著的自信心，这都是有可能的。但马斯克也表示，在Starship携带宇航员之前，他希望其已经完成了“数百次”无人飞行，将额外卫星送入轨道，以供Starlink网络使用，该网络提供高速互联网接入。Starship可以批量发射这些卫星，而Falcon 9的货运能力较小。SpaceX在火箭发展方面的矛盾之处在于，它的速度比任何竞争对手都快，但也比NASA所需的速度慢。但无论旅行速度如何，SpaceX刚刚迈出了通向星际的下一步。■

Mr Musk has said that he hopes Starship will make “at least six more flights this year”. That is just about plausible, even allowing for his infamous over-confidence. But Mr Musk also says that before Starship carries astronauts, he wants it to have completed “hundreds” of uncrewed launches, carrying additional satellites for its Starlink network, which provides high-speed internet access, into orbit. Starship can launch these satellites in larger batches than the Falcon 9, which has a smaller cargo capacity. The paradox of SpaceX’s approach to rocket development is that it is both faster than any of its competitors, and also slower than NASA needs. But whatever its speed of travel, SpaceX has just taken its next step towards the stars. ■

AI模型可以提升角球战术 (AI models can improve corner-kick tactics)
=====================================================

足球教练应该注意 (Football coaches should pay attention)
---------------------------------------------

![球员们在看着球，布莱顿角球，布莱顿与霍夫阿尔比恩对阵利物浦，英超联赛，足球。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_STP501.jpg)

对于谷歌DeepMind的**TO ZHE WANG**来说，角球就像国际象棋一样。部分原因是因为两者都涉及对抗双方准备对单个即将发生的举动作出反应。但也无疑是因为它们也可能会受到人工智能的革命。

TO ZHE WANG at [Google DeepMind](https://www.economist.com/1843/2019/03/01/deepmind-and-google-the-battle-to-control-artificial-intelligence), an artificial-intelligence (AI) company, corner kicks are like games of chess. Partly because both feature opposing sides poised to react to a single imminent move. But also, no doubt, because they too may be revolutionised by AI.

人工智能模型在**充足数据的环境**中可以取得成功。足球更是满足了这一要求。精英球员穿着能测量心率、位置、速度和施加力量的马甲；团队分析人员观看数小时的录像，统计控球时间百分比和传球、射门、进球次数。3月19日发表在《自然通讯》上的一篇论文中，**王**先生与他的同事与利物浦足球俱乐部的员工合作，将这些数据输入到一种称为图神经网络（GNN）的统计模型中。然后他们能够使用这个模型预测哪位在场球员最终会与球首次接触，其准确度与人类专家相似。

AI models [thrive where there is abundant data](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/03/13/how-to-train-your-large-language-model). Football more than satisfies this requirement. Elite players wear vests that measure heart rate, position, speed and force exerted; team analysts watch hours of footage to tally possession percentages and numbers of passes, shots and goals. In a paper published on March 19th in *Nature Communications*, Mr Wang and his colleagues worked with staff at Liverpool Football Club to feed this data into a statistical model known as a graph neural network (GNN). They then were able to use this model to predict which on-field player would wind up making first contact with the ball with levels of accuracy similar to human experts.

全世界的教练们应该在场边的沙发前兴奋地踱步。在一场标准足球比赛的90分钟里，很少会遇到相同的情况。但角球是可以反复出现的，它是专业训练的重点。在这方面表现优异是值得的。在这项研究论文发表时排在英超联赛榜首的阿森纳，已经从角球中攻入13球，总季进球为70球。在比赛的这个部分获得小优势可能会产生很大差异。

Coaches around the world should be pacing in front of their dugouts in excitement at the news. During a football match’s standard 90 minutes, it is rare to encounter the same situation twice. But corner kicks, which are eminently repeatable, are the focus of hours of specialist training. And doing well in them pays off. Arsenal, sitting at the top of the Premier League when this research paper was published, have scored 13 goals from corners out of a season total of 70. Small advantages in this part of the game can make a big difference.

DeepMind的GNN通过建立从7176次角球中收集的所有22位球员的数据之间的统计关系来运作。每个角球战术最终被表示为352维空间中的一个向量：这对人类来说是不可想象的，但对计算机来说很容易处理。类似展开的角球最终会在这个空间中靠近，让模型可以预测新的战术。

DeepMind’s GNN works by establishing statistical relationships between data collected from all 22 players during 7,176 corner kicks. Each corner routine was eventually represented as a vector in a 352-dimensional space: impossible for a human to visualise, but easy for a computer to process. Corners that unfolded similarly wound up close together in that space, allowing the model to make predictions about new set pieces.

除此之外，这个模型还能够利用这个分析来提出新战术。根据利物浦的五名专家给出的评分，人工智能生成的角球战术与人类教练提出的战术一样出色。事实上，在展示了50对角球（一个是真实的，一个是有AI建议改进的），90%的AI建议获得了大多数评委的赞同。

The model was also capable of using this analysis to suggest new tactics. And, based on ratings given by five experts from Liverpool, AI-generated corner-kick tactics were just as good as those suggested by human coaches. In fact, shown 50 pairs of corners, one real and one with an AI-suggested improvement, 90% of the AI suggestions found favour with the majority of judges.

**王**先生承认自己“并不是足球迷”，表示这项运动提供了一个安全、可控的试验场来开发有用的人工智能技术，这些技术将来可能会应用于医疗保健或国防。毕竟，足球不是生死攸关的问题。正如利物浦前任经理比尔·尚克利曾经观察到的那样，它比那更重要。■

Mr Wang, who confesses he is “no football fan”, says that the sport offers a safe and controllable test-bed to develop helpful AI technologies that might one day be used in health care or defence. After all, football is not a matter of life and death. It is, as Bill Shankly, a former Liverpool manager, once observed, much more important than that.■

XL牛胆犬为何变得如此危险 (How XL Bullies became such dangerous dogs)
======================================================

责任在于几代育种 (Generations of breeding are to blame)
--------------------------------------------

![一只名为Pippa的XL恶霸在私人安全的狗场上奔跑和散步。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_STP001.jpg)

**在2021年，十岁的杰克·利斯在威尔士卡尔菲利镇拜访朋友时，被一只名为“野兽”的狗致命袭击。这只狗猛烈袭击他，导致杰克的母亲只能通过他的鞋子来认出儿子的身体。**

IN 2021, WHILE visiting a friend’s house in the Welsh town of Caerphilly, ten-year-old Jack Lis was fatally attacked by a dog called Beast. It mauled him so severely that Jack’s mother could identify her son’s body only from his shoe.

根据英国政府的统计数据，这类致命袭击事件呈上升趋势。在过去几十年里，平均每年的狗袭击致死率都低于三起，但在2022年上升到了六起，在2023年上升到了16起（见图表）。成立于2023年6月的英国Bully Watch UK组织致力于收集有关这一问题的证据，该组织称自从杰克·利斯之后的大部分死亡案例是由被怀疑为超大号美国恶霸犬（或这类狗的混种）所造成的。

According to British government statistics, such fatal attacks are on the rise. After decades with an average annual dog-attack fatality rate below three, the number rose to six in 2022 and 16 in 2023 (see chart). Bully Watch UK, a group set up in June 2023 to gather evidence on the problem, attributes most deaths since that of Jack Lis to attacks by suspected Extra Large or ‘XL’ American Bully dogs, or crosses with them.

![XL恶霸](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_STC861.png)

这类狗看起来像斗牛犬，但体型是它们的两到三倍。它们有宽阔的头颅、强大的颚部和高度肌肉发达的体格，这是由于大型美国斗牛犬之间的近亲交配所导致的。由于外观上的差异，英国的育种者得以在2014年开始引进XL恶霸犬，尽管长期以来已禁止斗牛犬。最初几年，这类狗的数量仍然很有限。随后疫情爆发，拥有狗的吸引力激增，一些XL恶霸犬的价值也随之飙升。这引发了繁殖狂潮，随着它们的数量激增，袭击事件也大幅增加。

These dogs look like pit-bulls, but are two to three times their size. They have a broad head, powerful jaws, and a highly muscled physique, the result of inbreeding between large American pit-bulls. This difference in appearance meant that British breeders were able to start importing the XL Bully dog in 2014, despite a long-standing ban on pit-bulls. For a few years their numbers remained modest. Then the pandemic hit and the allure of dog ownership surged, catapulting the value of some XL Bullies. It sparked a breeding frenzy, and as their population exploded, so did the number of attacks.

这并非仅仅是英国的问题。据信，在美国、加拿大、德国等地也发生了被怀疑是XL恶霸犬的人员死亡事件，尽管许多国家不区分斗牛犬种类，因此很难获得准确的数据。

This is not a problem unique to Britain. Fatalities from suspected XL Bullies have also been seen in America, Canada, Germany and elsewhere, though as many countries do not distinguish between pit-bulls, good data are hard to come by.

受害者主要是成年人，突然袭击，往往是无端的。只有少数伤害是致命的，但许多伤害是改变人生的。在2023年，XL恶霸犬占英国狗群的比例不到1％，但根据Bully Watch UK的说法，这些狗却对44％的人类遭受的狗袭击事件负有责任。他们估计，与其他所有犬种相比，这一品种的威胁性高出270倍。

The victims are mostly adults, attacked suddenly and often without provocation. Only a small number of injuries are fatal, but many are life-changing. In 2023 XL Bullies made up less than 1% of Britain’s dog population and yet, according to Bully Watch UK, the dogs were responsible for 44% of dog attacks on people. They estimate the breed is 270 times more deadly than all other dog breeds combined.

它们的血统有助于解释它们的侵略性。斗牛梗被培育出来是为了赢得斗犬比赛，这类比赛从两只动物开始，最终只剩下一只。尽管自1835年以来在英国，1976年以来在美国，这类比赛就被明令禁止，但由于有人以此进行赌博，因此很多情况下这类比赛都是地下进行的。由于繁殖最优秀的斗犬可以赚取利润，培育者选出那些具有顽强和“斗志”的动物，即使受重伤也能继续战斗下去。几十年来，斗牛梗培育出了突然袭击以及能够忍受严重伤害而不后退的能力。而这种遗传历史也存在于XL恶霸犬中。“这些狗因被培育出具有侵略性，可能会继承侵略性，”剑桥兽医学院的遗传学家大卫·萨根说道。“无论你如何对待它们，其中一部分狗可能会表现出侵略性。”

Their ancestry helps explain their aggression. Pit-bull terriers were bred to win dog fights, contests which begin with two animals and end with one. Though illegal in Britain since 1835 and in America since 1976, the fights’ popularity as a forum for betting means many continue underground. With money to be made by breeding the best fighters, handlers selected those with tenacity and “gameness”—the ability to keep fighting despite serious injuries. Over decades, the pit-bull terrier developed the ability to attack suddenly, and sustain grave injuries without retreating. This genetic history is present in the XL Bully. “These dogs, being bred for aggression, are likely to inherit aggression,” says David Sargan, a geneticist at Cambridge Veterinary School. “However well you treat them, a proportion of them may explode.”

自1991年《危险犬法》实施以来，英国已限制了四种斗犬品种，直到2023年底XL恶霸犬才被禁止。那些未注册的XL恶霸犬现在将被宰杀。但如果有注册的狗，它们可以在公共场所佩戴口套和拴绳。这是积极的，但依然让狗主人们处于风险之中。据Bully Watch UK称，自2021年以来已有三名专业饲养者遭受袭击身亡。至少目前，在其他这类狗广受欢迎的国家，狗主人们的保护措施则更少。 ■

Britain has restricted four breeds of fighting dog since the Dangerous Dogs Act of 1991, but it was not until the end of 2023 that XL Bullies were banned. Those that are unregistered will now be destroyed. But existing registered dogs can be kept if they wear a muzzle and lead in public. That is positive, but still leaves owners at risk. According to Bully Watch UK, three professional handlers have been killed since 2021. And for now at least, in other countries where these dogs are popular, owners have even less protection. ■

在乔治·奥威尔小说《1984》中的反乌托邦世界里，大哥凭借着一个“诗歌制作机”让大众麻木不仁，这台机器能够自动生成流行曲的歌词，从而消除社会的人类创造力。如今，许多人工智能（**AI**）模型生产音乐本身，有些甚至是免费的。毫不奇怪，许多人担心未来充斥着普遍而缺乏情感的曲调，人类音乐家也可能在这个过程中被边缘化。然而，也有一些更为积极的迹象，表明人工智能有可能推动音乐创作的繁荣。

IN THE dystopia of George Orwell’s novel “1984”, Big Brother numbs the masses with the help of a “versificator”, a machine designed to automatically generate the lyrics to popular tunes, thereby ridding society of human creativity. Today, numerous artificial-intelligence (AI) models churn out, some free of charge, the music itself. Unsurprisingly, many fear a world flooded with generic and emotionally barren tunes, with human musicians edged out in the process. Yet there are brighter signs, too, that AI may well drive a boom in musical creativity.

**AI** 音乐创作并不是什么新鲜事物。叫做“基于规则”的第一个模型可以追溯到上世纪50年代。那些模型通过艰苦地将音乐理论原则转化为算法指令和概率表，来确定音符和和弦的进行。输出的音乐听起来很不错，但创造力有限。行业老手埃德·牛顿-雷克斯设计了一个这样的模型，为2012年在伦敦成立的Jukedeck公司打下基础，他认为这种方法在当时还算不错，但现在已经不再相关。

AI music-making is nothing new. The first, so-called “rules-based”, models date to the 1950s. These were built by painstakingly translating principles of music theory into algorithmic instructions and probability tables to determine note and chord progressions. The outputs were musically sound but creatively limited. Ed Newton-Rex, an industry veteran who designed one such model for Jukedeck, a London firm he founded in 2012, describes that approach as good for the day but irrelevant now.

**改变时代的最明显的证据** 出现在2023年8月。这是**Meta**，一个社交媒体巨头，发布了**AudioCraft**的源代码时。**AudioCraft**是一组利用机器学习构建的大型“生成性”音乐模型。全球的**AI**公司立即开始使用**Meta**的软件来训练新的音乐生成器，加入了额外的代码。**AudioCraft**中的一个模型**MusicGen**，分析了约28个月的近400,000段录音中的模式，得出了33亿个“参数”或变量，使算法能够对提示生成声音模式。这为真正新的**AI**作品创作创造了前所未有的空间。

The clearest demonstration that times have changed came in August 2023. That is when Meta, a social-media giant, released the source code for AudioCraft, a suite of large “generative” music models built using machine learning. AI outfits worldwide promptly set about using Meta’s software to train new music generators, many with additional code folded in. One AudioCraft model, MusicGen, analysed patterns in some 400,000 recordings with a collective duration of almost 28 months to come up with 3.3bn “parameters”, or variables, that enables the algorithm to generate patterns of sounds in response to prompts. The space this creates for genuinely new AI compositions is unprecedented.

这种模型的使用也变得更加简单。**伦敦**的**稳定性AI**公司去年发布了一个模型**Stable Audio**，这是牛顿-雷克斯先生最近工作的地方。该模型训练了大约**800,000**首音轨。用户可以通过输入文本和音频片段来指导它。这使得很容易上传，比如一段吉他独奏，并让其以爵士钢琴或黑胶唱片播放的方式重新编曲。澳大利亚新南威尔士大学的**奥利弗·宝恩**说，音频提示有两个重要作用。首先，即使是熟练的音乐家也很难用文字表达音乐。其次，因为大多数音乐训练数据只有很粗略的标记，即使是一个庞大的模型也不一定能理解要求以例行进程组成的四小节桥段，（这种风格源自斯科特·约普林**（Scott Joplin**）的作品“The Entertainer”）。

Such models are also getting easier to use. In September Stability AI, a firm based in London at which Mr Newton-Rex worked until recently, released a model, Stable Audio, trained on some 800,000 tracks. Users guide it by entering text and audio clips. This makes it easy to upload, say, a guitar solo and have it recomposed in jazzy piano, perhaps with a vinyl playback feel. Audio prompts are a big deal for two reasons, says Oliver Bown of Australia’s University of New South Wales. First, even skilled musicians struggle to put music into words. Second, because most musical training data are only cursorily tagged, even a large model may not understand a request for, say, a four-bar bridge in ragtime progression (the style familiar from Scott Joplin’s “The Entertainer”).

很显然，这种潜力是巨大的。但是业内很多人仍然持怀疑态度。一种普遍的看法是**AI**永远不可能创作真正的音乐。因为正如一个音乐家朋友最近告诉**特拉维夫****Meta** **AI**实验室的工程师约瑟夫·阿迪所说的那样，“没有人让它心碎”。这可能是事实，但一些**AI**公司认为他们已经找到了一种方法，可以保留和再现他们音乐用户的“独特音乐风格”，就像**伦敦**附近成立的LifeScore公司所说的那样。LifeScore的**AI**限制在以一种方式重新编排用户原始录音中的元素，以保持音乐的感觉，而不是将它们转变成全新的东西。

The potential, clearly, is vast. But many in the industry remain sceptical. One widespread sentiment is that AI will never produce true music. That’s because, as a musician friend recently told Yossef Adi, an engineer at Meta’s AI lab in Tel Aviv, “no one broke its heart”. That may be true, but some AI firms reckon that they have found a way to retain and reproduce the “unique musical fingerprint” of their musician users, as LifeScore, a company founded near London, puts it. LifeScore’s AI limits itself to recomposing the elements of a user’s original recordings in ways that maintain the music’s feel, rather than turning them into something radically new.

将成百上千个单独录制的声音和乐器麦克风音轨（或称之为"音桩"）插入到**LifeScore的**模型中大约需要一天的时间，这些音轨通常用于制作一首原创歌曲。但一旦完成，耗资约1000万美元研发的该软件可以在几秒钟内将每个音轨重新制作成新的节奏、曲调或音乐风格。参与这一过程的音乐人随后选择哪些混音曲保留。**传统**上，手动混音一首热门曲目往往需要一名或多名高价专业人员花费数周的时间。

It takes about a day to plug into LifeScore’s model the dozens of individually recorded vocal and instrumental microphone tracks, or stems, that go into producing an original song. Once that’s done, however, the software, developed at a cost of some $10m, can rework each stem into a new tempo, key or genre within a couple of seconds. The song’s artists, present during the process, choose which remixes to keep. Manually remixing a hit track has traditionally taken one or more highly paid specialists weeks.

LifeScore的联合创始人汤姆·格鲁伯表示，“我们被客户的请求淹没了”，客户包括**索尼音乐**、**环球音乐集团**和**华纳音乐集团**等。一首原创发布作品通常被制作成了少量到十几个不同的混音版本。但一个客户计划发行数以千计的原始曲目**AI**版本，每个版本针对不同的市场。包括**粉红佛洛依德**的**戴维·吉尔摩**和德国流行歌手**汤姆·盖贝尔**在内的艺术家们利用LifeScore的**AI**来支持网站，让粉丝可以根据个人口味轻松生成新的混音。


LifeScore, says Tom Gruber, a co-founder, is “literally swamped with requests” from clients including Sony Music, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group. An original release is typically turned into anywhere from a handful to a dozen remixes. But one client aims to release a dizzying 6,000 or so AI versions of an original track, each targeting a different market. Artists including Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour and Tom Gaebel, a German pop singer, use LifeScore’s AI to power websites that allow fans to generate, with a few clicks, new remixes adapted to personal tastes.

如果这似乎进展迅速，值得注意的是，**AI**对音乐的影响仍处于早期阶段。围绕着使用受版权保护的录音训练模型的法律不确定性已经减缓了发展的步伐。为了节省这方面的成本，**音乐生成**的训练集中大多数回避了流行歌曲，特拉维夫的阿迪博士表示。尽管输出效果颇佳，但模型还不够“艺术化”来生成完整的故事性歌曲。谱聚合**（Harmonic misalignments）**是很常见的。旧金山的**OpenAI**公司称，他们的**MuseNet**模型在实现“奇怪组合”（例如将肖邦风格与低音和鼓结合的曲风）方面存在困难。

If this seems like dizzying progress, it’s worth noting that AI’s impact on music is still in its early days. Legal uncertainties over the use of copyrighted recordings to train models have slowed development. Outfits that have coughed up for licensing fees note that this can get expensive. To save on that cost, MusicGen’s training set mostly sidestepped hits, says Dr Adi. Though output is pretty good, he adds, the model is not yet “artistic enough” to generate narratively complete songs. Harmonic misalignments are common. OpenAI, a San Francisco firm, for its part, says its MuseNet model struggles to pull off “odd pairings”, such as a Chopin style that incorporates bass and drums.

开发人员认为，随着更好音乐的更大的训练数据集，大部分短板将会被克服。**稳定性AI**发言人表示，虽然**稳定音频**对于连贯结构的音乐现在的处理时长上限是约90秒，升级后将能产出更长，并拥有“完整音乐性”的作品。但是，仅仅根据**AI**的生成成熟曲目来评判音乐**AI**的能力，大多数情况下都忽略了重点。这项技术最大的潜力，至少目前是如此，还在于其他方面。一部分潜力在于业余爱好者得以提升。**AI**可以完成许多人技术能力无法达到的任务。因此，**AI**吸引了大批新手参与音乐制作。这对“卧室制作人”来说是一大助益，**柏林**的Native Instruments公司的产品主管西蒙·克劳斯称之为。

In time, bigger training sets of better music will largely overcome such shortcomings, developers reckon. A Stability AI spokesperson says that while Stable Audio’s top duration for coherently structured music—“intro, development and outro”—is now about 90 seconds, upgrades will produce longer pieces with “full musicality”. But judging music AI by its ability to crank out polished tracks mostly misses the point. The technology’s greatest promise, for now at least, lies elsewhere.

以Native Instruments的**AI** "RX"为例，这是一个能够纠正音高和节奏等错误的“助手”。对于后者，在意中采用的动态时间弯曲**（dynamic time-warping）**技术通过切割或插入具有匹配音色的声音薄片来对音符进行移位。公司的**AI**还确定了对用户选择的歌曲进行的混音和制作过程。然后，它将在用户自己的创作中复制或至少近似于相同昂贵的处理。**佛罗里达大学**柏克莱的一家名为**Boomy**的在线“音乐自动化”平台用于“低摩擦”制作歌曲，用户通过文本提示进行创作，目前拥有200多万用户。该公司将用户的（经过审核的）创作上传到流媒体服务，从中获得一部分收入。

Part of it is the empowerment of amateurs. AI handles technical tasks beyond many people’s capabilities and means. As a result, AI is drawing legions of newbies into music-making. This is a boon for experimentation by what Simon Cross, head of products at Native Instruments, a firm based in Berlin, calls “bedroom producers”.

**AI**也服务于专业音乐人。例如，《芭比娃娃》和《奥本海默**（Oppenheimer）》的音轨在后期制作中通过RX进行了清理。另一个应用领域是“风格转换**（style transfer）**”，在这里模型将用一种乐器录制的音乐转换成似乎来自另一种乐器的声音，通常与用户请求的一些变化。风格转换也用于声音。一家位于**伦敦**的初创公司**Voice-Swap**开发了一个模型，通过由被支付的专业歌手唱出的音频切片，并由该服务的用户重新编排成歌词，这样用户可以支付版税来出售生成的曲目。**AI**工具已经存在，可以将歌手的声音再现为其他语言。一家叫做Yamaha的日本乐器制造商的声音合成工具**Vocaloid**就是其中之一，它可以通过一个母语者唱的翻译作为**AI**的模板来模仿，并重新排列、修改和拼接原唱的微小片段。

Consider RX, a Native Instruments AI “assistant” that corrects errors in things like pitch and timing. For the latter, software time-shifts notes by cutting out or inserting slivers of sound with matching timbre, a process called “dynamic time-warping”. The company’s AI also determines what mixing and mastering processes were performed on a song of a user’s choosing. It then replicates, or at least approximates, the same expensive processing on the user’s own creations. Boomy, an online “music automation” platform for what Alex Mitchell, its ceo, describes as “low-friction” song production with text prompts, has more than 2m users. The company, based in Berkeley, California, uploads users’ (vetted) creations to streaming services and collects a cut of revenues.

**Meta**的阿迪博士表示，**音乐生成**及其竞争对手现已广泛被成就卓越的音乐人们用作“无限灵感”的来源，以此来找到有前途的创作点子。然而，这种灵感最终是否能成功，归根结底还是听众决定。 ■

AI serves professionals, too. The soundtracks to “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” were cleaned up in post-production with RX, for example. Another application area is “style transfer”, in which models transform music recorded with one instrument into sounds that seem to come from a different one, often with a twist or two requested by the user. Style transfers are also used for voice. A model developed by a startup in London called Voice-Swap slices up sounds sung by (remunerated) professional singers and rearranges the slivers into lyrics written by the service’s users, who pay licensing fees for the rights to sell the resulting tracks. And AI tools already exist to recreate singers’ voices in other languages. Vocaloid, a voice-synthesising tool from Yamaha, a Japanese instrument manufacturer, is one of many that can use a translation sung by a native speaker as a template for an AI to imitate as it rearranges, modifies and stitches together tiny snippets of the original singer’s voice.

Accomplished musicians now widely tap MusicGen and its competitors as sources of “infinite inspirations”, the better to alight upon promising composition ideas, says Meta’s Dr Adi. Whether such inspiration pays off will, ultimately, be up to the listener to decide. ■

缅甸军政府连续遭遇挫折，为外部势力提供了机会 (A string of setbacks for the junta in Myanmar presents an opportunity)
===========================================================================================

外部势力不应错失良机。 (Outside powers must not waste it)
-------------------------------------------

![插图，一只大军靴踩在一些小士兵身上](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_ASD002.jpg)

**3月17日**，缅甸军方领袖明昂莱尼将军停在离商业首都仰光不远的勃固，重新祭祀一座古老的佛塔。他敲响佛塔的钟九次，遵循一个古老的迷信，希望这样可以避免灾难。然而同一天，他的部队又失去了另一个城镇拉辛敦，这次是在西部的拉钦邦，交由叛军控制。

ON MARCH 17TH General Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of the junta that overthrew Myanmar’s democratically elected government in a coup more than three years ago, stopped at Bago, not far from the commercial capital, Yangon, to reconsecrate an ancient Buddhist pagoda. He struck the pagoda bell nine times, following an old superstition that this might avert disaster. It did him no good: that same day his forces lost yet one more town, Rathedaung, to rebel forces, this time in Rakhine state in the west.

随着军方失去对国家的控制，危机感变得更加明显。然而对于备受痛苦的缅甸人民和民主，军队感受到的压力却提供了机遇。一直在与军队作战的少数民族和民主力量比以往更加团结。在外部适当的支持下，他们可能能够开始为没有将军主导的未来奠定基础。

As the junta loses its grip on the country, its sense of crisis is palpable. Yet for Myanmar’s battered people and democracy, the pressure under which the army finds itself presents an opportunity. The ethnic and democratic forces that have been fighting the army are more united than before. With appropriate support from outside, they may be able to start laying the groundwork for a future without the generals.

军方的困境在去年10月底急剧加剧，当时来自多元种族边境地区的三个民兵组织发动了名为“1027行动”的攻势。该行动以开始日期取名。他们在靠近中国边界的掸邦北部对军方及其盟友发动了闪电袭击。三兄弟联盟是由阿拉干军（AA）、缅甸国家民主联盟军和塔昂民族解放军组成，攻占了大量前哨基地。今年1月，叛军夺取了老街，这是一个臭名昭著的基地，中国黑帮老板和与军方勾结的人在那里经营网络赌场和网络诈骗。

The junta’s troubles mounted sharply in late October, when three militias from the ethnically diverse borderlands launched “Operation 1027”, named for the date it began. They staged lightning attacks on the junta and its allies in northern Shan state, bordering China. The Three Brotherhood Alliance, a grouping of the Arakan Army (AA), the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, overran scores of outposts. In January the rebels seized Laukkai, a notorious base for Chinese mafia bosses and junta allies running online gambling dens and internet scams.

1027行动激励了其他人。民兵在东南部克伊那邦和西部钦邦取得了成功。而拉钦邦则成为最新的战场。代表阿拉干佛教徒的AA在那里取得了惊人的军事成功。一周前，他们占领了该邦南部兰里岛上的主要城镇，紧邻丘库比港，中国在那里发展了一个深水港和输送石油天然气到其西南内陆的码头。本周，AA部队抵达了邦府实兑的郊外。

Operation 1027 inspired others. Militias have achieved successes in Kayin state in the south-east and in Chin state in the west. Rakhine state is the latest front. The AA, which represents ethnic-Rakhine Buddhists, has had astonishing military success there. A week ago it seized the main township on Ramree island in the south of the state—next to Kyaukpyu, where China has developed a deepwater port and terminals piping oil and gas to its landlocked south-west. This week AA forces reached the outskirts of Sittwe, the state capital.

军方的反应始终是毫不区别地使用暴力。上月底，炮火袭击繁忙的兰里市场，造成十几名平民丧生。3月10日，海军舰艇炮击了实兑附近的一个沿海城镇。军队士气低落。今年2月，当军方宣布征召年轻男女时，泰国大使馆前很快排起了长队。

The junta’s response, as ever, is indiscriminate violence. Late last month heavy shelling killed a dozen civilians in a busy Ramree market. On March 10th navy vessels shelled a coastal town near Sittwe. Army morale is low. When in February the junta announced conscription for young men and women, queues quickly formed at Thailand’s embassy.

许多未试图逃离的人已加入忠于流亡的全国团结政府（NUG）的“人民防卫部队”。军方几乎失去了对边境的控制，使其无法从征税和非法交易走私毒品、宝石、木材和人口中获取资金。

Many of those not trying to flee have joined “people’s defence forces” loyal to the national unity government (NUG) in exile. The junta has all but lost control of the borders, depriving it of funds from tax collection and rackets smuggling drugs, gems, timber and people.

军方的羞辱加剧了各种反对派之间的日益融洽。今年1月，NUG和三个主要民族武装组织宣布了共同目标，即终结军事统治，促进联邦、民主的未来。长期支持军方的中国正与其他国家达成交易。中国支持了三兄弟联盟，并用铐子带走了老街的大佬们。中国肯定会寻求与丘库比的AA妥协，以保护其能源供应。

The junta’s humiliation is compounded by growing accommodation among a multifarious opposition. In January the NUG and three major ethnic armed groups declared shared goals to end military rule and foster a federal, democratic future. China, which had long supported the junta, is doing deals with others. It backed the Triple Brotherhood Alliance and flew Laukkai’s kingpins out in handcuffs. China will surely seek an accommodation with the AA at Kyaukpyu in order to protect its energy supplies there.

除了中国，其他外部势力对最近的发展漠不关心，这是令人担忧的。让中国主导的缅甸对任何国家都不符合利益。然而，美国受到干扰。印度呼吁对话，但提供了很少其他支持。东盟这个由10个国家组成的东南亚团体则胆怯地坚守着草率的“五点共识”，而军方甚至都假装不履行。

The indifference to recent developments of external powers, other than China, is concerning. A Myanmar over which China establishes dominance is in no country’s interests but China’s. Yet America is distracted. India has called for dialogue but offered little else. The ten-country South-East Asian club, ASEAN, timidly sticks to a lame “five-point consensus” that the junta does not even pretend to honour.

相反，东盟和西方应该采取更多举措，在反对派团体之间促进对话，督促他们达成共识，关于未来的缅甸该如何治理。援助应该不断增加。令人鼓舞的是，曼谷新兴的文职政府正在远离军方。

Instead, ASEAN and the West should do much more to foster dialogue among opposition groups, nudging them towards a consensus about how a post-junta Myanmar might be governed. Aid should be ramped up. It is encouraging that the new civilian government in next-door Thailand, which recently replaced an army-led administration, is tilting away from the junta.

泰国现在应该进一步设立一个正式的援助走廊，通过该走廊，自己和其他国家可以发送食物和药品。本月日本提供了另外3700万美元，这是一个良好的开端，东盟、西方甚至印度都应效仿。不仅仅是缅甸人对于看到他们的国家摆脱长期噩梦有兴趣。 ■

Thailand should now go further and set up a formal aid corridor, through which it and others can send food and medicine. This month Japan offered a further $37m—a good start, which ASEAN, the West and even India should copy. It is not only Burmese who have an interest in seeing their country emerge from its long nightmare.■

印度的选举可能是世界上最昂贵的 (India’s election could be the world’s most expensive)
===================================================================

印度的大公司一直在购买“选举债券”，大多数是为纳伦德拉·莫迪的执政党。 (Big Indian companies have been buying “electoral bonds”, mostly for Narendra Modi’s ruling party)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

人们参加印度阿萨姆邦古瓦哈蒂的公众集会

Ask which of this year’s many elections will be the most expensive, and most people would say America’s. They could well be wrong. India’s most recent general election, in 2019, was already the most costly at the time by some estimates, with campaign spending conservatively put at $8.5bn. America’s presidential poll the next year exceeded that. But India’s parliamentary vote this spring will be much dearer and could exceed the $10bn-16bn that is likely to be splurged on the White House race.

如果问今年众多选举中哪一个将是最昂贵的，大多数人会说是美国的。但他们很可能错了。一些估算表明，印度最近的大选（2019年）已经是史上最昂贵的，保守估计竞选支出达到85亿美元。接下来的一年，美国总统选举的开支超过了这一数字。但印度今年春天的议会选举将更加奢侈，可能超过100亿至160亿美元，这是可能花在白宫竞选上的金额。

India’s ballooning campaign costs have often been linked to illicit cash, sometimes from the criminal underworld. In recent days, however, a spotlight has fallen on corporate funding after Indian companies, including some of the country’s biggest, were revealed to have made political donations worth hundreds of millions of dollars via an opaque system of “electoral bonds”. Proceeds went overwhelmingly to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

印度不断膨胀的竞选成本经常与非法资金有关，有时来自犯罪黑社会。然而，最近几天，焦点转向了企业资助，因为印度公司，包括一些最大的公司，被揭示通过一种不透明的“选举债券”系统捐赠价值数亿美元，大部分资金都流向执政的人民党。

When the government launched the bonds in 2018, it said they would stop the flow of “black cash” into politics by providing a legal yet anonymous channel for donations. But in a rare setback for the prime minister, Narendra Modi, the Supreme Court declared the scheme unconstitutional on February 15th. It ordered the State Bank of India (SBI), the bonds’ sole issuer, to provide details of who bought and received them by March 6th to the Election Commission, which was required to publish those details a week later.

政府在2018年推出这种债券时称，它们将通过提供一个合法但匿名的渠道捐赠，阻止“黑钱”流入政治。但在对总理纳伦德拉·莫迪来说是罕见的挫折中，最高法院于2月15日宣布该计划违宪。它命令债券的唯一发行者、印度国家银行（SBI），于3月6日向选举委员会提供购买和接收债券者的详细信息，并要求该委员会在一周后发布这些细节。

After a failed attempt to extend the deadline until late June, the bank complied. The Election Commission published the data on March 14th, just two days before announcing that the election would be held over six weeks starting from April 19th (with results on June 4th).

在未能延长截止日期直至6月下旬的尝试失败后，该银行遵守了命令。选举委员会于3月14日发布了数据，就在两天后宣布选举将从4月19日开始，历时六周(并于6月4日公布结果)。

Data published so far only identify bond purchasers and recipients without showing which donation went to which party. They have caused a stir nonetheless, as about 50% of $2bn in bond proceeds since 2018 has gone to the BJP, compared with some 12% to its main national rival, the Congress party. The 25 largest buyers of bonds were all Indian companies. Some depend heavily on government contracts and approvals. Several were previously targeted by tax or investigative agencies. A handful bought bonds worth considerably more than their profits.

到目前为止公布的数据只识别了购买债券和接收债券的人，没有显示哪笔捐款流向了哪个政党。然而，这些数据已经引起轩然大波，因为自2018年以来20亿美元的债券收益中，约50%流向了人民党，而国大党只有约12%。25家购买债券最多的公司都是印度公司。一些公司严重依赖政府合同和批准。其中几家公司购买的债券金额远远超过它们的利润。

The BJP denies any wrongdoing. But opposition leaders and activists accuse the government of strong-arming donors into buying bonds for the BJP while deterring them from funding opposition parties, for fear that Indian authorities could get hold of bond buyers’ data via the government-run SBI. Rahul Gandhi, a Congress parliamentarian, branded the scheme “the world’s largest extortion racket”.

人民党否认有任何不当行为。但反对党领袖和活动人士指责政府强迫捐助者购买人民党的债券，同时阻止他们资助反对党，因为他们担心印度当局可能通过政府运营的国家银行获取债券购买者的数据。国大党的议员拉胡尔·甘地将该计划称为“世界上最大的勒索集团”。

One surprise from the data was the identity of the single biggest bond buyer. That was Future Gaming and Hotel Services, a lottery and gaming company based in the southern state of Tamil Nadu whose donations totalled 13.68bn rupees ($165m). Tamil Nadu’s ruling party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, says it received 37% of that total. It is among ten parties that have identified their bond donors. Neither the BJP nor Congress have done so.

数据中的一个惊喜是最大的单一债券购买者的身份。这家公司叫做未来游戏和酒店服务，是总部位于印度南部泰米尔纳德邦的一家彩票和游戏公司，其捐款总额为136.8亿卢比(1.65亿美元)。泰米尔纳德邦执政党德拉维达·莫瑙特拉·卡扎干声称他们收到了总额的37%。这是十个已确定其债券捐赠者的政党之一。人民党和国大党均未这样做。

Other leading bond buyers are more familiar names, such as Megha Engineering and Infrastructures, an engineering and construction firm that has won big government contracts. The top ten buyers also included Vedanta, a big mining company, and Bharti Airtel, India’s second-largest telecom carrier by subscribers. The biggest individual buyer was Lakshmi Mittal, an Indian steel magnate based in Britain.

其他主要债券购买者是更为熟悉的公司，如梅格哈工程和基础设施，这家工程和建筑公司赢得了大笔政府合同。前十名的购买者还包括印度一家大型矿业公司垂利达和印度第二大电信运营商巴蒂·艾尔特尔。最大的个人购买者是印度钢铁大亨拉克什米·米塔尔，他住在英国。

More details may soon emerge if the SBI complies with an additional Supreme Court notice to provide serial numbers for each bond, allowing activists to match buyers with recipients. That could be politically damaging for several parties but especially the BJP. Indian companies have long made political donations, often funding incumbents and opponents simultaneously. But Mr Modi is particularly close to a handful of Indian tycoons who have thrived in the past decade.

如果印度国家银行遵守最高法院的额外通知，提供每张债券的序列号，那么更多详细信息可能很快就会浮出水面，这将使活动人士可以将购买者与受益者匹配。这可能对几个政党造成政治上的损害，尤其是人民党。印度公司长期以来一直在进行政治捐款，经常同时资助执政党和反对党。但莫迪和过去十年中蓬勃发展的少数几个印度亿万富翁之间的关系尤为密切。

The BJP says that its share of donations reflects the number of seats it won in 2019 (303 out of 543 in the lower house) and the number of states it governs (12 out of 28, versus three for Congress). It also blames Congress for the influx of illicit cash in politics after its prime minister, Indira Gandhi, banned corporate funding in 1969. Her son, Rajiv, lifted the ban in 1985 but clandestine cash payments continued, not least because opposition donors feared retribution from those in power.

人民党表示，它在2019年赢得的席位数量(在543个下议院席位中赢得303个)和执掌的邦的数量(28个中有12个，而国大党只有3个)反映了它所得到的捐款份额。它还指责国大党让非法资金涌入政治，因为在1969年它的总理英迪拉·甘地禁止了企业资助。她的儿子拉吉夫在1985年解除了禁令，但秘密现金支付仍在继续，尤其是因为反对党捐助者害怕当局的报复。

Critics say the bond scheme did not stop the flow of undeclared cash to parties, which still far exceeds what they report officially and is often used to buy votes or bribe candidates to switch sides. But even activists who challenged the scheme in court are divided on how to replace it. Some favour total transparency, calling for all donations to be made digitally while others argue that anonymous channels are essential to safeguard opposition donors.

批评人士称，债券计划没有阻止未申报现金流向政党，这种现金流量仍远远超过他们正式报告的数额，通常用于贿赂选民或贿赂候选人改变立场。但即使是在法庭上挑战该计划的活动人士也意见不一，对于如何取代它看法不一。一些支持完全透明，主张所有捐款都应以数字形式进行，而另一些认为匿名渠道对保护反对派捐助者至关重要。

The Communist Party of India (Marxist), which governs the state of Kerala and was among the bond scheme’s legal challengers, advocates a German-style system of state funding for political parties. But its leader, Sitaram Yechury, says there is little support among other parties. “Nobody wants to stop corporate funding,” he says. The risk now, he warns, is that if campaign costs continue to grow “parties like ours will find it very difficult to contest”. ■

马克思主义印度共产党管理着喀拉拉邦，并且是债券计划的法律挑战者之一，主张采用德国式的政党国家资金系统。但该党领导人希塔拉姆·耶成鲁说，其他政党对此没有多少支持。他说：“没有人想要停止企业捐助。”他警告说，现在的风险是，如果竞选成本继续增长，“我们这样的政党将很难参选”。■

日本和韩国之间的关系蓬勃发展 (Relations between Japan and South Korea are blossoming)
====================================================================

但好景不长。 (But how long can the good times last?)
-------------------------------------------

![插图展示了日本和韩国国旗，两国国旗交叉形成两个头部相对并拥抱的人](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_ASD001.jpg)

《**Eye Love You**》中的女主角本宫优莉是一部在东亚热播的电视剧，《**Eye Love You**》中是一位具有读心术的日本女性。她的特殊能力让她在爱情上备受困扰，因此她放弃了爱情，直到遇到了韩国实习生尹泰昂。尹泰昂是一位英俊的韩国人，他的思维是用韩语的，导致本宫女士的读心术无效。两人开始了一段热烈的恋情。这部剧是日本首部以韩国演员出演主角的黄金时段爱情故事。自一月开播以来，在两国都拥有大批粉丝。

MOTOMIYA YURI, the heroine of “Eye Love You”, a hit television series in East Asia, is a Japanese woman with the power to read minds. Her gift makes romance hard, so she gives up on love—until she meets Yoon Tae-oh, a hunky South Korean who becomes an intern at her chocolate company. He thinks in Korean, rendering Ms Motomiya’s mind-reading moot; the two begin a torrid affair. The show is the first Japanese prime-time love story to feature a Korean actor as the lead. Since its launch in January, it has amassed legions of fans in both countries.

《**Eye Love You**》反映了荧屏之外的发展。自2022年韩国总统尹锡悦上任以来，两国及美国盟友之间的关系蓬勃发展。问题在于这段美好时光能否持续。日本1910年至1945年对韩国的殖民遗留问题仍然困扰着这段新兴恋情，而今年两国的政治变化可能会影响其进展。日本首相岸田文雄曾考虑本周访问韩国与尹锡悦会面（并观看日本棒球明星大谷翔平在首尔的比赛）。然而，韩国即将举行的议会选举以及日本持续存在的金融丑闻让此行变得困难。这段关系的发展将对印度-太平洋地区的实力平衡产生重大影响。

“Eye Love You” echoes developments off screen. Since Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea’s president, took office in 2022, relations between the two neighbours and American allies have blossomed. The question is whether the good times can last. The legacy of Japan’s colonisation of Korea between 1910 and 1945 haunts the budding romance. And political changes in both countries this year could upset its development. Kishida Fumio, Japan’s prime minister, had considered a visit to South Korea this week to meet Mr Yoon (and to watch Ohtani Shohei, a Japanese baseball star, play in Seoul). A looming parliamentary election in South Korea and a continuing financial scandal in Japan made that difficult. How the relationship evolves will have big implications for the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific.

解决方案始于尹锡悦当选之后。在他的前任文在寅执政期间，两国关系因对过去日本的暴行互相指责而恶化。2018年，韩国最高法院作出两项裁决，要求日本公司赔偿曾被迫在其战时工厂工作的韩国人以及他们的遗属；然而，日本认为这个问题在1965年签署的条约和付款后已经解决。面临着日本资产的清算，尹锡悦成立了一家基金会，用得益于恢复正常关系的韩国公司的资金来赔偿原告。这个计划在公众中不受欢迎，但尹锡悦坚持推动。

The rapprochement began after Mr Yoon’s election. Under his predecessor, Moon Jae-in, ties had frayed amid recriminations over past Japanese atrocities. A particular bugbear was two decisions in 2018 by South Korea’s Supreme Court, which ordered Japanese companies [to compensate Koreans](https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/12/22/japanese-firms-resist-compensating-forced-wartime-labourers-from-korea) forced to work in their wartime factories, as well as their surviving relatives; Japan considers the matter settled by a treaty signed and payments made in 1965. With liquidation of the Japanese assets looming, Mr Yoon created a foundation to compensate the plaintiffs, using funds from South Korean firms that benefited from normalised relations. The plan was unpopular with the public, but Mr Yoon persevered.

去年3月16日，尹锡悦访问了东京，这是两国超过十年来的第一次官方访问。两个月后，岸田文雄访问了首尔，并在一个国家公墓向为韩国独立而战的烈士们表示敬意。两位领导人自那时起已经举行了五次峰会，包括去年夏天与美国总统乔·拜登在戴维营的[历史性会晤](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/10/why-joe-biden-will-host-japan-and-south-koreas-leaders-at-camp-david)。安全合作日益加深。三国进行了规模庞大的海上和空中联合演习。如今，在朝鲜发射导弹时，它们能够实时共享数据。

Mr Yoon travelled to Tokyo on March 16th last year, the first official visit between the two countries in more than a decade. Mr Kishida went to Seoul two months later and paid his respects at a national cemetery where Korean independence fighters are interred. The two leaders have held five more summits since, including a [landmark meeting with Joe Biden](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/10/why-joe-biden-will-host-japan-and-south-koreas-leaders-at-camp-david), America’s president, at Camp David last summer. Security co-operation has deepened. The three nations have conducted large-scale joint drills at sea and in the air. When North Korea launches missiles, they now share data in real time.

商业活动和相互交流正在复苏。去年夏天，韩国重新被列入日本的“白名单”，加速了出口程序，而在2019年曾被移出。去年12月，两国达成了一项货币互换协议，近八年前的一次协议已经到期。两国的商业领导人都发出了乐观的信号。

Commercial activity and mutual exchanges are reviving. Last summer South Korea was put back on Japan’s “whitelist”, which speeds up exports, having been taken off it in 2019. In December the two countries struck a currency-swap deal, nearly eight years after their last one had expired. Business leaders in both countries are sounding optimistic notes.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_ASC846.png)

公众舆论似乎出现了变化，至少相比于文在寅政府时期的对抗。根据日本智库Genron与韩国东亚研究院（EAI）在2023年底进行的联合调查，首次自2013年起，有关日本观感较正面的日本人人数首次超过了持负面观感的人数（见图表）。与此同时，韩国人对日本的看法已经从2020年的低谷中恢复。

Public opinion appears to be shifting, at least compared with the antagonism during Mr Moon’s administration. In a joint survey conducted in late 2023 by Genron, a Japanese think-tank, and the East Asia Institute (EAI), a South Korean one, more Japanese had positive views of South Korea than had negative ones for the first time since the survey began in 2013 (see chart). Meanwhile South Koreans’ views of Japan have recovered from a low in 2020.

然而，仍然存在许多警惕。安全合作仍然是通过美国进行。去年，日本对韩国的外国直接投资为13亿美元，远远低于2012年的近45亿美元。2022年至2023年间，韩国人对日本的看法实际上略有恶化。许多韩国人认为，日本未能为过去所做出足够赔偿，而尹锡悦则对此视而不见。支持这段关系的人士认为，岸田可能对充分利用尹锡悦代表的机遇过于谨慎。

Yet much wariness remains. Security co-operation is still conducted via America. Japanese foreign direct investment into South Korea was $1.3bn last year, a far cry from nearly $4.5bn in 2012. South Korean views of Japan actually worsened slightly between 2022 and 2023. Many South Koreans feel Japan has not done enough to atone for the past and that Mr Yoon is giving it a free pass. Proponents of the relationship believe Mr Kishida has been too cautious about seizing the opportunity that Mr Yoon represents.

日本担心尹锡悦的继任者可能推翻他的政策，正如文在寅曾于2015年签署的议定书，解决与“慰安妇”问题有关的议定书。“慰安妇”是二战期间遭到强迫并被迫为日本士兵提供性服务的韩国及其他妇女的委婉说法。尹锡悦设立的负责解决强迫劳工案件的基金缺乏资金，面临着法庭上的挑战。韩国最高法院已经判决支持15名原告获得赔偿，其中有四人拒绝接受这一机制并对其进行上诉。随着更多案件在法庭上审理，有资格获得赔偿的人数预计会增加，或许会超过1000人。韩国前驻日本大使、律师申甲秀表示，“最终之路可能会遇到严重的困难”。

Japanese worry that Mr Yoon’s successor may overturn his policies, much as Mr Moon did with a deal made in 2015 to settle issues related to “comfort women”, as Koreans and others forced into brothels for the benefit of Japanese soldiers during the second world war were euphemistically called. The foundation that Mr Yoon tasked with settling the forced-labour cases lacks funds and faces its own challenges in court. South Korea’s Supreme Court has ruled in favour of settlements for 15 plaintiffs. Four refused to accept the mechanism and have appealed it. As additional cases move through the courts, the number of people entitled to payments is set to grow, perhaps to more than 1000. There may yet be “serious snags in the final path to the end”, says Shin Kak-soo, a lawyer and former South Korean ambassador to Japan.

国内政治变革也可能危及这段关系。尹锡悦的执政期至2027年结束（韩国领导人任期限制为一届），随着接近任期结束，他对自己政党的控制力将减弱。即使他的政党在四月的议会选举中未能重获多数议席，他的权力也会更早消退。他的反对派喜欢煽动反日情绪，无论如何都会批评他的政策。岸田在国内的地位不稳定，他可能无法在9月的日本执政党领导层选举中幸存。他的继任者可能更加谨慎，不愿冒险关系日本与韩国的关系。如果唐纳德·特朗普于11月当选美国总统，他不太可能像拜登一样敦促盟友之间相处融洽。

Domestic political change also threatens to knock the relationship off course. Mr Yoon’s hold over his own party will wane as the end of his term, in 2027, draws closer (South Korean leaders are limited to one term in office). It may seep away even sooner if his party fails to recapture a majority in April’s parliamentary elections. His opponents, who enjoy stirring anti-Japanese sentiment, will criticise his policy either way. Mr Kishida’s standing at home is shaky—he may not survive elections for the leadership of Japan’s ruling party in September. His successor may prove more wary of taking risks on relations with South Korea. And if Donald Trump is elected president in America in November, he is unlikely to press his allies to get along as much as Mr Biden has.

尽管如此，有充分的理由相信当前的关系将持续下去。尹锡悦个人致力于日本的方式是少数韩国领导人所做过的。据一位前高级韩国官员称，尹锡悦在日本生活的童年经历（父亲当时是一位访问学者）使他对日本有了“好感”。

Nonetheless, there are good reasons to believe the current relationship will endure. Mr Yoon has personally committed himself to Japan in a way few South Korean leaders have. His childhood experience of the country, where he lived while his father was a visiting scholar, predisposed him to have “good feelings” towards Japan, says one former senior South Korean official.

另外，两个更大的结构性力量也在起作用。首先是世代更替。虽然对抗日本殖民统治仍然是韩国身份认同的一个支柱，但这段苦涩历史在当今年轻人中引起的激情减少，因为年轻人只通过教科书了解这段历史，据韩国孔府国立大学的林恩静称。最新的EAI调查显示，年龄是影响韩国人对日本持有正面看法的最重要变量之一。如今，韩国最受欢迎的电影是一部带有明显反日情绪的超自然恐怖片《**Exhuma**》，而这一信息被许多年轻观众忽略了。“我甚至没有考虑过反日情绪，”23岁的粉丝金度洪说，“我的血液没有因愤怒而沸腾。”

Two larger structural forces are also at work. First is generational change. While the struggle against Japanese colonialism remains a pillar of South Korean identity, the bitter history generates less passion among today’s youth, who learn about it only through textbooks, says Lim Eun-jung of Kongju National University. The latest eai survey suggests that age is among the most important variables affecting South Koreans’ favourable views of Japan. The highest-rated film in South Korea these days is “Exhuma”, a supernatural horror with seemingly anti-Japanese overtones—a message lost on many young viewers. “I didn’t even think about anti-Japanese sentiments,” says Kim Do-hoon, a 23-year-old fan. “My blood isn’t boiling from anger.”

其次是地缘政治变化。面对自信的中国、威胁的朝鲜和令人不安的俄罗斯，这两个东亚民主国家有越来越多的理由相处。这么做也有助于加强两国与美国的联盟。即使在韩国反对派圈子中，“对日本的立场正在逐渐改变，而主要原因是战略环境，”前外交官、进步派政治顾问尹松洛说。随着两国前瞻到明年，将迎来建立正式关系60周年，两国合作的“范围和深度”“比以往更广泛”，一位日本高级官员表示。届时将是两国 renew their vows 的绝佳时机。 ■

Second is geopolitical change. Faced with an assertive China, a threatening North Korea and a disruptive Russia, the two East Asian democracies have ever more reasons to get along. Doing so also helps strengthen both countries’ alliances with America. Even in South Korean opposition circles “the stance on Japan is changing little-by-little, and the main reason is the strategic environment,” says Wi Sung-lac, a former diplomat and adviser to progressive politicians. As the governments look ahead to next year, which will mark the 60th anniversary since they established formal relations, the “scope and depth” of their co-operation is “wider than ever”, says a senior Japanese official. It will be an opportune occasion for the two to renew their vows. ■

如何让印度变得更富有 (How to make India richer)
==================================

如果有更多的人在国内迁徙将会有所帮助。 (It would help if more people moved within the country)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_ASP001.jpg)

每天大约有二十多列火车从印度首都德里驶往比哈尔邦，这是一个贫困的东部邦。这周将增加更多列车，以便运送成千上万的比哈尔人回家庆祝洒红节，这是印度的一个色彩斑斓的印度教节日，今年定于3月25日。即便如此，希望出行的人数远远超过了火车座位数，不仅仅是在德里-比哈尔路线上，也包括印度其他数以百计的路线，这些路线连接着印度各个繁荣地区和腹地之间的人流。

Every day roughly two dozen trains set off from Delhi, India’s capital, to Bihar, an impoverished eastern state. This week more will be added to ferry the thousands of Biharis heading home to celebrate Holi, the Hindu festival of colours that falls on March 25th this year. Even so, there will be many more people hoping to travel than train seats—not just on the Delhi-Bihar routes, but also on the hundreds elsewhere in India that carry people between its pockets of prosperity and its hinterlands.

这种国内流动对于该国的发展至关重要。内部移民是城市经济的重要支柱。大城市吸引来自全国各地的专业人士。低技能移民在建筑工地工作、守卫大门和打扫卫生。他们寄回家的钱给亟需帮助的地区带来了缓解。然而，鉴于印度地区间巨大的收入差距，与中国等其他大而不平等的国家相比，移民人数相对较小。如果有更多印度人愿意移居，这个国家本可以更富有。

Such internal mobility is central to the country’s development. Internal migrants are an important pillar of urban economies. Big cities pull in professionals from across the country. Lower-skilled migrants work on construction sites, guard gates and clean houses. The money they send home brings relief to areas that desperately need it. Yet given enormous income disparities between Indian regions, the number of Indians who migrate is small by comparison with other large and unequal countries such as China. The country could be much richer if more did so.

以维杰·库马尔为例，他在德里一个高档郊区当保安。他每月赚取15000卢比（181美元），远高于在家乡的收入。他寄往比哈尔的8000卢比（96美元）足以养活全家并供孩子上学。根据印度年度经济调查的估计，2016-17年国内汇款价值相当于国内生产总值的1%。

Consider the case of Vijay Kumar, who works as a security guard in a posh suburb of Delhi. He earns 15,000 rupees ($181) a month, far more than he would at home. The 8,000 rupees ($96) he transfers to Rataul in Bihar is enough to feed his family and send his children to school. According to an estimate in India’s annual economic survey, domestic remittances were worth the equivalent of 1% of GDP in 2016-17.

如果印度人开始更多地迁移，这个数字本可以更多。由于印度经济中很大一部分是非正规的，缺乏关于移民数量的可靠数据。一项在2021年进行的调查估计，印度29%的人口（将近4亿人）是移民。这包括在同一邦内迁移的人。只有12%（1.6亿人）在邦际间迁移。无论哪种类型的迁移，其主要原因都是婚姻，占所有迁移的72%。出于工作原因迁移的人数仅占11%，包括邦内迁移。其中大部分是男性：只有2%的女性是为工作而迁移。

That number could be much larger if Indians started moving more. Reliable data on the number of migrants do not exist, in part because so much of India’s economy is informal. One survey conducted in 2021 estimates that 29% of Indians (nearly 400m people) are migrants. That includes those that move within the same state. Just 12% (160m) move between states. The overwhelming reason for both types of migration is marriage, accounting for 72% of all moves. The share of those moving for work is just 11%, including migration within states. Most of them are men: only 2% of women move for work.

按照国际标准，印度的迁移非常有限。一项2014年的研究发现，印度的内部迁移水平低于82个受考察国家中的所有国家，除了一个。最新的全球可比数据目前不可获得，但作为国内迁移的替代标志的城市化率表明印度仍然落后。世界银行估计，2021年有35%的印度人居住在城市，比之中国（63%）、印度尼西亚（57%）和其他中低收入国家（43%）的比例都低。

By international standards migration in India is weak. One study in 2014 found that India’s internal migration levels were lower than in all but one of the 82 countries examined. More recent globally comparable data are not available, but urbanisation rates, a proxy for domestic migration, suggest that India still lags. The World Bank estimates that in 2021 35% of Indians lived in cities, a lower share than China (63%), Indonesia (57%) and other lower-middle-income countries (43%).

另一个问题是许多迁移是“循环式的”，印度管理学院的钦迈·桑贝说，他是《印度移动》一书的作者。他估计，印度有1亿暂时的移民，他们最终会返回家乡。但只有当家庭在城市中度过几代人的时候，才会创造持久的财富。返回的移民也给既有的农村经济带来压力。

The other issue is that a lot of migration is “circular”, says Chinmay Tumbe of the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad and author of “India Moving”. He reckons that there are 100m temporary migrants in the country, who will return home eventually. But lasting wealth is created only when families spend generations in cities. Returning migrants also add pressure to strained rural economies.

为什么印度人的活动不够频繁？在城市，大多数工作对移民来说过于不稳定。住房昂贵，收入不足以支付。库马尔先生薪水的四分之一用于租房，“一个小小房间和一个公共厕所”。文化和语言的差异也是另一个障碍，在一个拥有数以百计不同语言并没有交流语言的国家中。全国各地主义运动抬头也是一个阻碍因素。今年，印度的科技中心班加罗尔陷入了关于语言问题的斗争。市政当局要求企业将标识主要使用该邦语言卡纳达或面临丧失执照的风险。为本地人保留工作岗位的呼声日益高涨。

Why are Indians not more mobile? In cities most work is too precarious for migrants to put down roots. Housing is expensive and jobs do not pay enough to cover it. A quarter of Mr Kumar’s salary goes on renting “a pigeon hole and a shared toilet”. Differences in culture and language are another barrier in a country with hundreds of different languages and no lingua franca. So is the rise of nativist movements across the country. This year Bangalore, India’s tech capital and a magnet for migrants, has been embroiled in a battle over language. Municipal authorities have required businesses to display signs predominantly in Kannada, the state’s tongue, or risk losing their licences. Calls to reserve jobs for locals are getting louder.

缺乏社会保障也是另一个障碍。移民跨越邦界时失去福利待遇，比如获得公共卫生保健的权利。福利支出偏向于村民，在农业中享有丰厚的补贴，并可以获得保障性的就业计划。在城市几乎没有类似的福利。

The lack of a safety-net is another obstacle. Migrants lose welfare benefits, such as access to public health care, when they cross state borders. Welfare spending is skewed towards villagers, who enjoy generous subsidies in agriculture and can get access to a guaranteed workfare programme. Few equivalents exist in cities.

改变的迹象已经显现。突如其来的疫情封锁引发了移民大规模离开城市，他们的遭遇促使国家政府改善政府福利计划的可携带性。现在，一个倡议允许人们在全国范围内获取补贴的粮食。南部的制造中心卡纳塔克邦和泰米尔纳德邦正计划提供安全住所，以鼓励更多的女性前往那里，可能是考虑到中国制造业崛起中女性工人的作用。

Some signs of change are visible. After a sudden pandemic-era lockdown triggered an exodus of migrants from cities, their travails prompted the national government to improve the portability of government welfare schemes. One initiative now allows people to access subsidised grain anywhere in the country. The southern manufacturing hubs of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are planning to provide safe accommodation to encourage more women to move there, possibly mindful of the role female workers played in China’s manufacturing boom.

在国家层面，钦迈·桑贝建议政府建立一个州际迁移委员会，帮助移民并保障他们的自由流动权。总理纳伦德拉·莫迪强调国家团结和国家产业的重要性，使印度在2047年独立100周年之际成为一个发达国家。使人们更容易地流动将是实现这一目标的途径之一。 ■

At the national level, the government could establish an inter-state migration council to help migrants and ensure their freedom of movement, suggests Mr Tumbe. Narendra Modi, the prime minister, extols the importance of national unity and national industries to make India a developed country by the time it celebrates 100 years of independence in 2047. Making it easier to move around would be one way to achieve that goal. ■

凯特·温斯莱特探讨如何成为一位优秀的独裁者 (Kate Winslet explores how to be a good autocrat)
====================================================================

《政权》是一部荒谬的剧集，背后却有着致命的严肃观点。 (“The Regime” is a silly show with a deadly serious point)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![电视剧《政体》中的一帧，凯特·温丝莱坐在桌子的头部。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_CUP001.jpg)

在中欧某未透露名称国家的变幻莫测的领袖Elena Vernham被人抬着在宫殿里穿行，身处移动式氧气舱内。她与父亲的防腐尸体交谈。在[凯特·温丝莱](https://www.economist.com/culture/2021/05/12/kate-winslet-and-the-economy-of-talent-on-screen)的出彩表演中，她的口齿不清显露出类似《查理与巧克力工厂》中被宠坏的小妮莲Veruca Salt的任性。Elena的古怪行为、爱情与吞并被记载在“政体”中，这是一部讽刺性戏剧，现在在美国播出，不久将在英国上映。这是一部愚蠢的电视节目，却道出了专制统治的严肃问题。

The capricious leader of an unnamed country in central Europe, Elena Vernham is carried around her palace in a mobile oxygen chamber. She chats with her father’s embalmed corpse. In [Kate Winslet’s](https://www.economist.com/culture/2021/05/12/kate-winslet-and-the-economy-of-talent-on-screen) star turn, her lisping petulance recalls Veruca Salt, the spoiled brat in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”. Elena’s antics, amours and annexations are chronicled in “The Regime”, a satirical drama out now in America and in Britain soon. It is a silly TV show that makes serious points about autocracy.

Elena和她的国家是真实人物和地点的巧妙合成。其中包含了罗马尼亚共产主义时期的朱查斯库家族和1991年失败的苏联政变的阴影，当时国家电视播放的是《天鹅湖》（在这里是《塞维利亚理发师》）。Elena的典礼编发发型唤起了乌克兰火爆女政治家Yulia Tymoshenko的形象。但主要影响来自[Vladimir Putin的俄罗斯](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/14/rogue-russia-threatens-the-world-not-just-ukraine)。故事以一位粗犷的下士Herbert Zubak（Matthias Schoenaerts饰）抵达宫殿开端。

Elena and her country are sly composites of real people and places. There are echoes of communist Romania under the doomed Ceausescus and of the failed Soviet coup of 1991, when state tv broadcast “Swan Lake” (here it is “The Barber of Seville”). Elena’s ceremonial braided hairstyle evokes Yulia Tymoshenko, a Ukrainian firebrand. But the main influence is [Vladimir Putin’s Russia](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/14/rogue-russia-threatens-the-world-not-just-ukraine). The action begins with the arrival in the palace of a rough-hewn corporal, Herbert Zubak (Matthias Schoenaerts).

由于参与了一起大屠杀，无人忘记，他被称为“屠夫”。这展现了该剧的第一个洞察：Herbert不仅没有因为耻辱而受挫，反而因此得到了提拔。Elena，像其他专制统治者一样，知道受牵连的人更加易控。她这样的体制依赖于相互勒索，每个朝臣对其他人都有把柄；一个诚实的人是没有任何用处的。如果有鲜血流出，很多人都有牵连，就像俄罗斯的大人物在电视上为普京进行战争煽动时一样。

Because of his role in a massacre, which nobody lets him forget, his nickname is “the Butcher”. This is the show’s first insight: Herbert is promoted not in spite of his disgrace but because of it. Elena, like other autocrats, knows compromised people are pliable. Systems like hers rely on mutual blackmail, whereby every courtier has dirt on all the others; an honest person is useless. If blood is shed, many hands are dipped in it, as when Russian bigwigs appear with Mr Putin in his televised warmongering.

接下来，考虑那个移动式氧气舱。Elena的忧郁症—她对孢子恐惧—取笑了那些痴迷于自身安危而忽略公民福祉的洁癖领导人。但她的古怪行径也是权力的体现。如果她说有有害孢子弥漫在她的宫殿，那么就会有。每个人为她的糟糕歌唱鼓掌，就如同普京的马屁精让他在冰球比赛中获胜一样。

Next, consider that portable oxygen chamber. Elena’s hypochondria—she has a horror of spores—spoofs germophobe leaders who are fanatical about their own welfare yet neglect their citizens’. But her quirks are also exertions of power. If she says noxious spores pervade her palace, they do. Everyone applauds her atrocious singing, just as Mr Putin’s lickspittles let him win at ice hockey.

其目的不是让任何人相信这种幻想与谎言：而是迫使麾下人接受，从而凸显专制者的权力。你不该相信克里姆林宫否认在其古拉格杀害[Alexei Navalny](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2024/02/22/alexei-navalny-didnt-just-defy-putin-he-showed-up-his-depravity)的说法。如果你信了，谋杀的恐吓信息就会淡化。其目的在于对致命伤害添加智力侮辱。

The goal is not to make anyone believe in such fantasies and lies: it is to force underlings to swallow them, so underlining the autocrat’s power. You are not meant to believe the Kremlin’s denial that it killed [Alexei Navalny](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2024/02/22/alexei-navalny-didnt-just-defy-putin-he-showed-up-his-depravity) in Russia’s gulag. If you did, the murder’s intimidating message would be blunted. The aim is to add intellectual insult to lethal injury.

Elena在电视讲话中称呼群臣为“爱人们”。就像专制者一样，她声称与人民有一种神秘联系，像武器一样动员他们。实际上，她鄙视他们为肮脏的乡巴佬，见不得他们。她担心他们的忠诚，当正常辩论被扼杀时，统治者往往表现如此。

Elena speaks to her subjects in televised addresses, calling them “my loves”. As autocrats do, she claims to have a mystical connection to the people, wielding them in arguments like a mace. In truth, she despises them as grubby bumpkins and loathes meeting them. She frets over their loyalty, as rulers tend to when normal debate is stifled.

“他们乐于看到美国被揍”，一名党务官对同胞说。和很多小国一样，Elena在亲近美国的同时也在抱怨不满美国的干预。她试图在华盛顿和北京之间玩弄把戏，并发起了半烂的自给自足尝试。然而即使她抨击美国，她也在享受其流行文化，像巴沙尔·阿萨德在叙利亚崩溃时仍追捧自己的iTunes账号一样，在晚餐时瞧着《老友记》。

“They love to see America punched in the mouth,” an apparatchik says of his compatriots. As in many smallish countries, Elena oscillates between courting and resenting American involvement. She tries to play Washington off against Beijing and launches half-baked bids for autarky. Yet even as she denounces America she enjoys its pop culture, watching “Friends” over dinner, rather as Bashar Assad clung to his iTunes account as Syria imploded.

除了抨击西方，陷入困境时，Elena还采取两种常用的专制统治策略。她吹嘘打击腐败（尽管自己也有海外财富）并抢占邻近领土一部分，这并非入侵，再重复一遍。随之而来的制裁意味着一位不满的内部人士无法再访他在迈阿密的节庆住所。情况日趋恶化，奸臣们必须权衡何时撤退，这个困境对开罗到加拉加斯的心腹来说再熟悉不过了。

Apart from bashing the West, in a fix Elena deploys two go-to autocratic tactics. She trumpets a crackdown on corruption (notwithstanding her own offshore stash) and seizes a slice of adjacent territory in what is not, repeat not, an invasion. The ensuing sanctions mean a disgruntled insider can no longer visit his pied-à-terre in Miami. As circumstances deteriorate, the cronies must calculate when to run, a dilemma familiar to henchmen from Cairo to Caracas.

艺术上，这部剧有其缺陷。它试图使你关心角色，即使在讽刺他们。尖刻的对话没有《继承者》中的讽刺语句那般幽默。但像专制者那样，它击中了要害，尤其是在捕捉这种权力本质上是某种变形表演的方式上。

Artistically, the show has flaws. It tries vainly to make you care about its characters even as it sends them up. The waspish dialogue is not as funny as the invective in [“Succession”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/02/what-happens-when-a-story-loses-a-main-character). But, autocratically, it hits the mark—above all in capturing the way this sort of power is itself a kind of twisted performance.

“这只是戏剧吗？”一名内部人士在一位寡头被公开羞辱时疑问。在这样的政权中，戏剧却是政治手段的基本模式。关键不仅在于“视觉效果”比事件本身更重要。专制者以礼仪和场面取代政治竞争（就像俄罗斯[荒谬的选举](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/17/vladimir-putins-sham-re-election-is-notable-only-for-the-protests)那样）。政治是民主的拙劣模仿，是一个讽刺的闹剧，所有人被拉进这个玩笑中。换言之，专制统治往往是一个愚蠢的表演，背后却带着悲剧性的严肃信息。■

“Could it just be theatre?” that insider wonders when an oligarch is publicly humiliated. In regimes like this, however, theatre is the basic mode of statecraft. It isn’t only that “the visuals” matter more than the substance of events. The autocrat substitutes ritual and spectacle for political competition (as in Russia’s [farcical election](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/17/vladimir-putins-sham-re-election-is-notable-only-for-the-protests)). Politics is a pastiche of democracy, a satirical pantomime in which all are dragooned into the joke. An autocracy, in other words, is often a silly show with a tragically serious point.■

馆长致力于纪念德国在纳米比亚被遗忘的种族灭绝。 (A curator’s battle to commemorate Germany’s forgotten genocide in Namibia)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Historic photos from the genocide era hang on the wall of Herero activist Laidlaw Peringanda’s Genocide Museum of Swakopmund in Namibia.](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_CUP006.jpg)

![纳米比亚斯瓦科普蒙德市的赫雷罗活动家莱德劳·佩林甘达开设的种族屠杀博物馆墙上挂着种族灭绝时代的历史照片。]

There are plenty of reminders of the colonial past in Swakopmund, a town on Namibia’s coast, if you know where to look. Mechanics work beneath battered Mercedes; doughy cooks prepare doughy strudel; a guesthouse is named after a Bavarian prince. In the centre of town the privately run Swakopmund Museum is a mix of taxidermy and Germany. Near a stuffed seal is a cabinet of pilsner glasses used by those who left the Second Reich for German South-West Africa, as Namibia was known between 1884 to 1915. The museum’s curator concedes that it “does not tell the whole story” and cites a lack of funds.


如果你知道从哪里寻找，斯瓦科普蒙德市有很多殖民历史的提醒。修理厂里，技师在破旧的梅赛德斯车下忙碌；面团师傅在准备面团般的果馅面包；一家招待所以一个巴伐利亚王子的名字命名。在市中心，私人经营的斯瓦科普蒙德博物馆展示着动物标本和德国元素。在一只填充的海豹附近，放置了一架盛放第二帝国德国人在德国西南非洲（即纳米比亚，1884年至1915年之间的称呼）时使用的比尔森啤酒杯的橱柜。博物馆的馆长承认，“没有讲述完整的故事”，并提到资金短缺。

To grasp a fuller account of German colonialism, travel to the town’s outskirts. In front of a small house is an outbuilding no bigger than a Volkswagen SUV. It is probably the smallest museum in Africa; it is certainly one of the most important.

要了解更全面的德国殖民主义历史，可以前往市郊。在一座小屋前面，有一座不到大众汽车SUV大小的附属建筑。它可能是非洲最小的博物馆之一；它肯定是最重要之一。

The Swakopmund Genocide Museum memorialises what scholars have described as the first genocide of the 20th century. From 1904 to 1908 around 65,000 Herero people (80% of the total) and 10,000 Nama (50%) were killed as part of a brutal German response to a rebellion. The methods foreshadowed and inspired the Nazis. (The brown shirts worn by the Nazi Party’s paramilitary *Sturmabteilung* came from a surplus supply of colonial uniforms.) Thousands were crammed into concentration camps. Their skulls were sent to Germany for examination by eugenicist scientists.

斯瓦科普蒙德种族屠杀博物馆纪念了学者们称之为二十世纪第一次种族灭绝的事件。从1904年到1908年，大约65,000名赫雷罗人（总数的80%）和10,000名纳马人（50%）在一场残酷的德国镇压叛乱行动中丧生。这些手段预示并激励了纳粹。 （纳粹党的准军事组织**施图尔姆阿贝特盟**所穿的褐色衬衫来源于殖民制服的剩余供应。）成千上万的人被挤入集中营。他们的头骨被送往德国，由优生学科学家进行研究。

“I set this up because the Swakopmund Museum does not tell the story of my people,” says Laidlaw Peringanda (pictured), whose museum officially gained permission to operate in January. It is sparse, consisting mostly of homemade print-outs of black-and-white photos. The images are of skulls, emaciated children in camps and women chained together.

“我建立这个博物馆是因为斯瓦科普蒙德博物馆没有讲述我人民的故事，”最近正式获准运营的莱德劳·佩林甘达（如图所示）说道。这里简朴，主要是由黑白照片的自制打印品组成。这些图像是头骨、集中营中瘦弱的儿童和被锁在一起的妇女。

Aside from an old German rifle that Mr Peringanda swivels in his hand as he talks, there is just one artefact: an *ekori* (a traditional headdress worn by Herero women). It was sent by a rich Swiss woman who found it in her private collection. Many totems still remain outside Namibia.

除了佩林甘达先生谈话时手中悠转的一支古老德国步枪，这里只有一件手工艺品：*ekori*（赫雷罗妇女传统头饰）。这个头饰是一位富裕的瑞士女士从她的私人收藏中找到并送来的。很多图腾仍然留存在纳米比亚之外。

After more than five years of talks, [in 2021](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/05/20/germany-is-apologising-for-crimes-a-century-ago-in-namibia) Germany’s then foreign minister announced that “We will now officially call these events what they are from today’s perspective: genocide.” Germany promised to spend more than €1bn ($1.1bn) over 30 years on aid and development projects.

经过五年多的谈判，[2021年](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/05/20/germany-is-apologising-for-crimes-a-century-ago-in-namibia)德国前外交部长宣布：“从今天的角度来看，我们现在将正式称这些事件为种族灭绝。” 德国承诺在30年内在援助和发展项目上投入超过10亿欧元（约合11亿美元）。

Though some Herero worry that they will not see the cash, no other European country has offered to pay as much for colonial crimes in Africa. In 2013 Britain offered about £20m ($31m) in compensation to 5,000 elderly victims for abuse they suffered in Kenya in the 1950s, and only after a lawsuit. A Belgian commission was assembled to assess brutality in Congo but failed to issue an apology. France is keener on [returning artefacts](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/02/26/plundered-artefacts-return-to-west-africa-in-dahomey) than apologising.

尽管一些赫雷罗人担心他们看不到这笔款项，但没有其他欧洲国家像德国这样愿意为非洲殖民地罪行支付这么多钱。2013年，英国向在20世纪50年代在肯尼亚受到虐待的5000名老受害者提供了约2000万英镑（约合3100万美元）的赔偿，而且是在经过一场官司之后才提供的。比利时成立委员会评估刚果的暴行，但未能道歉。法国更愿意[归还文物](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/02/26/plundered-artefacts-return-to-west-africa-in-dahomey)，而不是道歉。

Mr Peringanda points out that Germany is no longer the main obstacle to a reckoning; there are two more important forces. The first is the Namibian government. Like neighbouring South Africa, from which the country seceded in 1990, Namibia is run by a party, SWAPO, whose legitimacy stems from its opposition to white rule. School textbooks make little mention of the genocide, lest it complicate the narrative that only they, SWAPO, resisted the whites. Ovambo, Namibia’s largest group, dominate SWAPO; Herero and Nama remain marginalised.

佩林甘达指出，现在德国不再是阻碍和解的主要障碍；还有两个更重要的力量。第一个是纳米比亚政府。与邻国南非相似，南非在1990年脱离独立，纳米比亚也是由独立党**SWAPO**执政，其合法性来自其反对白人统治。学校教科书很少提及种族灭绝，以免复杂化只有他们，即**SWAPO**，抵抗白人的叙事。瓦姆博（纳米比亚最大的族群）主导了**SWAPO**；赫雷罗人和纳马人仍处于边缘化地位。

The second target is recalcitrants in Swakopmund itself. A monument to the German soldiers who died in the “war” against the Herero and Nama still stands near the beach. The statue makes no mention of atrocities; some powerful townsfolk worry that it could damage tourism.

第二个目标是斯瓦科普蒙德本身的顽固分子。一座纪念在“战争”中对抗赫雷罗人和纳马人而牺牲的德国士兵的纪念碑仍然立在海滩附近。这座雕像没有提到暴行；一些有影响力的城镇居民担心它会损害旅游业。

Later your correspondent crosses town to where researchers have detected mass graves of Herero. In a grimly ironic twist, the site is a cemetery used by affluent residents of adjacent suburbs. Only a black stone monument built by Mr Peringanda marks who else lies beneath the ground. He erected it after the council stated that many Herero had died here in “mysterious circumstances”. His tiny but vital museum clears up any mystery. ■

随后，记者穿过城镇，抵达研究人员发现赫雷罗人大规模坟墓的地点。以极具讽刺意味的是，这个地点是富人区居民使用的墓地。只有佩林甘达建立的一个黑色石碑标识着地下谁还安息其中。市政委员会宣称在这里许多赫雷罗人死于“神秘的情况”。他建立了这座小而重要的博物馆，消除了任何谜团。■

============================================================================

克里斯汀·布莱西·福特重回聚光灯 (Christine Blasey Ford re-enters the spotlight)
-------------------------------------------------------------

![克里斯汀·布莱西·福特在2018年华盛顿国会山作证的照片。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_CUP003.jpg)

**回头的一条路。**作者：**克里斯汀·布莱西·福特**。*圣马丁出版社*；*320页*；*29美元和24.99英镑*

**One Way Back.** By Christine Blasey Ford. *St Martin’s Press; 320 pages; $29 and £24.99*

“大多数回忆录都是生活的背后故事。这本书却是故事的背后生活。”这是克里斯汀·布莱西·福特（Christine Blasey Ford）的《回头的一条路》开篇所说。**她自己也成为了**[2018年](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/09/28/kavanaugh-versus-blasey)的一个全球故事，那时候，她指控唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）提名的最高法院候选人布雷特·卡瓦诺（Brett Kavanaugh）在他们还是青少年时对她进行了侵害。她在参议院司法委员会面前的证词被大约两千万美国人通过电视观看，而卡瓦诺先生的[充满活力且满脸通红的否认](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/10/04/brett-kavanaughs-testimony-disqualifies-him-from-the-supreme-court)也同样备受关注。

“Most memoirs are the story behind a life. This is the life behind a story.” So begins “One Way Back” by Christine Blasey Ford, who became a global story herself i[n 2018](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/09/28/kavanaugh-versus-blasey), after she accused [Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/10/04/brett-kavanaughs-partisanship), Donald Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, of assaulting her when they were teenagers. Her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee was watched by around 20m Americans on television, as was Mr Kavanaugh’s [energetic and red-faced denial](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/10/04/brett-kavanaughs-testimony-disqualifies-him-from-the-supreme-court).

卡瓦诺最终在一场党派投票中被[确认](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/10/11/how-brett-kavanaugh-will-change-the-supreme-court)进入最高法院。但许多女性受到布莱西·福特的勇气激励，纷纷站出来。她收到来自42个国家和全美50个州的超过10万封支持信件，其中约四分之一的信件分享了个人性侵经历。这些通信者激发了她编写全面记述的决心，其中有这样一句致敬于他们的话：“谢谢你们。我终于要回信给你们了。”

Mr Kavanaugh was narrowly [confirmed](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/10/11/how-brett-kavanaugh-will-change-the-supreme-court) to the Supreme Court in a vote along party lines. But many women were inspired by Ms Blasey Ford’s courage to come forward. She received more than 100,000 letters of support from 42 countries and all 50 states, with about a quarter of them sharing personal experiences of sexual assault. These correspondents inspired her to pen her full account, which is dedicated to them: “Thank you. I’m finally writing you back.”

鉴于多年来的谩骂和死亡威胁——这迫使她花费巨资购买私人保镖——布莱西·福特重新公开露面的决定可能令人惊讶。尽管她的书没有提供戏剧性的新发现，但却展示了站出来的代价。她传达的信息是，与一些共和党人的指控相反，她的证词并非是一个政治动机驱使的“最后一刻的努力来阻止卡瓦诺的确认”。

Given a years-long smear campaign that included doxxing and death threats—requiring her to spend a small fortune on private security—Ms Blasey Ford’s decision to re-emerge publicly may be surprising. Though her book does not provide dramatic new revelations, it shows the cost of stepping forward. Her message is that, contrary to accusations by some Republicans, her testimony was not a politically motivated “last-minute effort to block Kavanaugh’s confirmation”.

事实上，这个过程既漫长又混乱。她煎熬于如何揭露她15岁时在华盛顿特区高档郊区一处家中遭受的袭击。她和卡瓦诺一样，都是在主要共和党圈子中长大的“华盛顿社区”孩子，当她发现自己被困在一个派对上的卧室里时。甚至前任总统唐纳德·特朗普最初在她描述她对当时17岁而醉醺醺的卡瓦诺试图脱下她衣服并捂住她的嘴以防她尖叫的记忆后，称她是一个可靠的证人和“很好的女士”。

Indeed, the process was protracted and messy. She agonised over how to reveal the assault she recalled occurring when she was 15 at a home in the posh suburbs of Washington, DC. She, like Mr Kavanaugh, was a “Beltway baby” raised in mainly Republican circles, when she found herself trapped in a bedroom at a party. Even former President Donald Trump initially called her a credible witness and “very fine woman” after she described her memory of Mr Kavanaugh, then 17 and drunk, trying to undress her and covering her mouth so she would not scream.

布莱西·福特是加州帕洛阿尔托大学的心理学教授，她第一次意识到她的“攻击者”是一位有权势的法官是在2004年，那时乔治·W·布什总统参加了他的婚礼。但直到卡瓦诺的名字出现在最高法院的候选名单上，她才觉得这是她的“公民责任”站出来。

Ms Blasey Ford, a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University in California, first realised that her “attacker” was a powerful judge in 2004, when then-President George W. Bush attended his wedding. But not until Mr Kavanaugh’s name appeared on a shortlist for the Supreme Court did she feel it her “civic duty” to step forward.

布莱西·福德决心独自一人去应对，显得天真且不够成熟。起初，她拒绝了法律帮助，并相信自己可以保持匿名。她写道：“百万年里，我从未想过我的脸会公开伴随这些指控。”

Determined to go it alone, Ms Blasey Ford comes across as naive and out of her depth. At first she refused legal help and believed she could remain anonymous. “Never in a million years did I think my face would publicly accompany the allegations,” she writes.

然而，她的名字被泄露，可能是由一位参议员，然后她受到了证词的压力。若当时她听从了硅谷的一些人的建议，聘请一位顶尖的共和党律师并更加果断地行事，历史可能会有所不同。

However, her name was leaked, possibly by a senator, and then she came under pressure to testify. History might have been different had she heeded advice from contacts in [Silicon Valley](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/03/12/why-is-it-so-hard-to-write-a-good-book-about-the-tech-world) to hire a top Republican lawyer and act more assertively.

如果这本书更早写就，它可能会成为一篇针对“不惜一切来恢复卡瓦诺名誉的机器”的抨击文章。而她的回忆录却是真诚且经常幽默的。读者们了解到这位低调的教授曾经部分将头发染成蓝色，并因获得见她最喜爱的乐队Metallica的邀请而摆脱了绝望的边缘。

Written earlier, the book would have been a diatribe against “the machine [that] would stop at nothing to rehabilitate Kavanaugh”. Instead her memoir is honest and often wry. Readers learn that the unassuming professor once dyed her hair partially blue and was pulled from the brink of despair by an invitation to meet her favourite band, Metallica, backstage.

《回头的一条路》感觉像是来自遥远过去的一封信。在克里斯汀·布莱西·福特作证五年之后，#MeToo的合唱逐渐消退，女性站出来公开指认那些据称虐待她们的男性。如今，一个保守的最高法院多数派已实现了[生殖权的削减](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/24/the-supreme-court-erases-the-constitutional-right-to-abortion)，而[卡瓦诺的任命](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/10/04/from-metoo-to-screwyou)则加速了这一进程。

“One Way Back” feels like a missive from a time long past. In the five years since Ms Blasey Ford’s testimony, the chorus of #MeToo, in which women came forward and publicly identified men who they said had abused them, has faded. Now a [rollback of reproductive rights](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/24/the-supreme-court-erases-the-constitutional-right-to-abortion) has been enabled by a conservative Supreme Court majority, which [Mr Kavanaugh’s appointment](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/10/04/from-metoo-to-screwyou) helped to cement.

布莱西·福特对她的证词如何展开有很多遗憾。但她说，她会“毫不犹豫”地再做一次。她冲浪，这项运动让她的磨难和这本书有了（陈词滥调的）隐喻。这本书并非由鬼写或制作精美，有时尴尬并有点错乱，但布莱西·福特“头高冲浪着回来”。她的口吻充满了厌恶的接受。“我感觉自己被相信了”，她写道，“但随后的回应却是一声谚语般的耸肩。” ■

Ms Blasey Ford has many regrets about how her testimony unfolded. But she would do it again, “absolutely”. She surfs, a sport that gives her ordeal and the book its (clichéd) metaphor. The book is not ghostwritten or slick, and is occasionally awkward and out of order, but Ms Blasey Ford is “riding the wave back” with her head held high. Her tone is one of disgusted resignation. “It felt like I had been believed,” she writes, “but then the response was a proverbial shrug.” ■

**Bad Therapy.** By Abigail Shrier. *Sentinel; 320 pages; $30. Swift Press; £20*

1935年，*哈珀*杂志发表了一篇悲伤的文章，谈到了年轻的美国人。两位作者、记者乔治·莱顿和理查德·赫尔曼认为一代人“在我们眼前腐烂”。冷漠和失望正在蔓延，犯罪行为也在增加。甚至高中学生也携带枪支，“只想获取他们能够得到的东西”。莱顿和赫尔曼将这一悲剧归咎于大规模的失业。他们的同时代人指责大麻。

In 1935 *Harper’s* magazine published a sorrowful article about young Americans. The authors, journalists George Leighton and Richard Hellman, argued that a generation was “rotting before our eyes”. Apathy and disenchantment were taking hold, together with criminality. Even high-school students were packing guns and were “out for what they can get”. Leighton and Hellman blamed mass unemployment for this tragedy. Some of their contemporaries pointed at marijuana.

大约50年后那篇文章发表，以及在那个据称正在腐烂的一代人拯救世界免受法西斯主义侵害的40年后，年长者再次抱怨年轻人走上了错误的道路。在1982年的一本名为《童年的消失》的书中，教育理论家尼尔·波斯曼认为青少年正在采纳成人的恶习，比如沉重饮酒和犯罪，并且过度追求性生活。他解释，电视是罪魁祸首。

Around 50 years after that article—and 40 years after the supposedly rotten generation had saved the world from fascism—older people again complained that the young were going awry. In a book, “The Disappearance of Childhood” (1982), Neil Postman, an educational theorist, argued that teenagers were adopting adult vices such as heavy drinking and crime, and having far too much sex. The chief culprit, he explained, was television.

现在又有两本书出版，探讨年轻人的困境和缺陷。它们几乎没有提及失业、大麻或电视；事实上，它们在年轻人陷入困境的原因上并不一致。原因改变了，衡量标准改变了。但年长者对青少年问题的绝对肯定态度并未改变。

Two more books have now been published about the troubles and flaws of young people. They say almost nothing about unemployment, marijuana or TV; indeed, they do not agree with each other about why the young are in such a mess. The causes change, the measurements change. What does not change is the absolute certainty with which older adults hold forth on the problems of youth.

《焦虑的一代》描述了一群遭受**心理疾病**前所未有水平困扰的群体。2019年，美国约五分之一的学生被诊断为或接受了抑郁治疗，而这一比例在十年前仅为十分之一。纽约大学的社会心理学家乔纳森·海德特指出，这不仅仅是坦率程度增加的迹象。自杀率也在上升，美国10至14岁**女孩**自2010年以来增加了一倍多。

“The Anxious Generation” describes a cohort suffering from unprecedented levels of [mental ill-health](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/02/27/generation-z-is-stressed-depressed-and-exam-obsessed). One-fifth of American students were diagnosed with or treated for depression in 2019, up from one-tenth a decade earlier. Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University, argues this is not just a sign of increased frankness. Suicides are rising too, more than doubling among American 10- to 14-year-old [girls since 2010.](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/05/03/suicide-rates-for-girls-are-rising-are-smartphones-to-blame)

智能手机和社交媒体是罪魁祸首。年轻人加入虚拟社区，而不是小而稳定的现实世界社区，在这里他们经历“每天都有数百万主要是临时角色的人参与的memes、时尚和短暂的小型戏剧的龙卷风”。智能手机如此迷人，以至于减少了对其他所有活动的兴趣。与波斯曼上世纪80年代抱怨青少年的问题相反，海德特先生表示现代青少年约会和性行为迟缓。

Smartphones and social media are the chief villains. Instead of small, stable real-world communities, young people join virtual ones, where they experience “a daily tornado of memes, fads and ephemeral micro-dramas, played out among a rotating cast of millions of bit players”. Smartphones are so alluring that they reduce interest in all other activities. Reversing Postman’s complaint about teenagers in the 1980s, Mr Haidt says that modern ones are slow to date and to have sex.

海德特先生在早前一本书**《美国心灵的宠溺》**中阐述了这些论点，该书解释了为什么大学生变得如此敏感。《焦虑的一代》认为问题要早得多，起因是过分保护的育儿风格。该书主张在上学时间禁止使用手机，防止青少年接触社交媒体，并且更经常让孩子放肆一些。所有这些建议听起来都很明智。有些甚至听起来很有趣。

Mr Haidt rehearsed some of these arguments in an earlier book, [“The Coddling of the American Mind”](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/09/27/the-real-victims-of-campus-activism-are-the-students), which explained why university students have become so sensitive. “The Anxious Generation” posits that the problems begin much earlier, with an over-protective style of child-raising. The book argues for banning phones during school hours, preventing pre-teens from accessing social media and letting children run wild more often. All the suggestions sound sensible. Some even sound fun.

《糟糕的心理治疗》同意年轻人深受困扰，但对原因有不同看法。对于阿比盖尔·莎瑞尔来说，问题的罪魁祸首不是技术，而是她所称的“心理健康产业”。将近五分之二的年轻美国人表示他们已从心理健康专业人士那里得到帮助，但她认为这给他们造成了巨大伤害。他们“不能忽视任何疼痛，无论多么微不足道”。治疗师剥夺了他们的主动性。被诊断为学习障碍和神经非正常的男孩 “不再有停止懒散的选择”。

“Bad Therapy” agrees that young people are deeply troubled, but disagrees about the cause. To Abigail Shrier, the culprit is not technology but what she calls the “mental-health industry”. Almost two-fifths of young Americans say they have received help from a mental-health professional, and it has done them great harm, she argues. They can “never ignore any pain, no matter how trivial”. [Therapists and counsellors](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/01/31/a-wave-of-films-and-television-shows-is-exploring-psychotherapy) have sapped them of agency. A boy who has been pronounced learning-disabled and neurodivergent “no longer has the option to stop being lazy”.

莎瑞尔女士之前曾写过有关**跨性别治疗**危险的文章，她对现代父母也有批评，尽管她的批评与海德特先生的略有不同。她认为父母渴望被孩子喜欢，希望他们永远幸福，导致他们扼杀和溺爱孩子。结果是一群“比以往任何时候都更加自我、没有纪律和令人讨厌的孩子”。由于孩子在没有明确规则的情况下成长，他们感到困惑和攻击性。当他们的行为变得令人困扰时，治疗师们被召唤。

Ms Shrier, who has previously written about the perils of [transgender treatment,](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/11/26/a-book-on-transitioning-girls-is-denounced-as-transphobic) also has sharp words for modern parents, although her criticism differs slightly from Mr Haidt’s. Parents’ desire to be loved by their children, and to see them always happy, leads them to stifle and coddle, she thinks. The result is a crop of “far more self-involved, undisciplined and unlikeable children” than any before. Because children grow up without clear rules, they are confused and aggressive. When their behaviour becomes troubling, the therapists are summoned.

《焦虑的一代》是更好的一本书。它认真对待反驳和证据不足之处；虽然可能听起来有点含混，但脚注是值得阅读的。海德特先生坚定的口吻偶尔会被个人的自述打断，这是一种愉快的中断。他本人也曾经历严重焦虑。他将智能手机给了他的儿子，而且在他非常年幼时就开始追踪他的行踪。

“The Anxious Generation” is the better book. It deals seriously with counter-arguments and gaps in the evidence; although it might sound like faint praise, the endnotes are well worth reading. And Mr Haidt’s assured tone is pleasantly interrupted by personal admissions. He, too, has struggled with severe anxiety. He gave his son a smartphone at a startlingly young age and used it to track his movements.

《糟糕的心理治疗》没有提供细腻的描绘。莎瑞尔女士与许多治疗师交谈过，但她宣称只信任那些坚称心理治疗会伤害年轻患者的人。当评估她不喜欢的观点时，比如儿童创伤经常会导致成年人问题的观点，她正确地坚持严格的证据。相比之下，她的一些观点是基于与朋友的对话和一个自由派家长抱怨他们孩子的Facebook群体。

“Bad Therapy” admits no nuance. Ms Shrier has spoken to many therapists, but she declares that she trusts only those who assert that therapy can harm young patients. When assessing arguments that she dislikes, such as the notion that childhood trauma often produces damaged adults, she rightly insists on rigorous evidence. By contrast, some of her own arguments are based on conversations with friends and on a Facebook group where liberal parents complain about their children.

两位作者都会受益于更多的旅行经历。海德特先生在纽约逗留，莎瑞尔女士在洛杉矶西部。他们从那些特权、有时疯狂的地方概括性地看待美国和世界其他地方。他们的有限视角导致了问题。海德特先生——在说到激烈竞争争取大学名额不能解释为何年轻美国人如此痛苦时——主张申请大学在英国“远不如此紧张”。这对英国读者来说会是个好的惊喜。

Both authors would have benefited from more travel. Mr Haidt hangs out in New York, Ms Shrier in west Los Angeles. They generalise from those privileged, sometimes nutty places to the rest of America and the world. Their limited perspectives lead them into trouble. Mr Haidt—in the course of saying that fierce competition for university places cannot explain why young Americans are so miserable—argues that applying to university is “far less fraught” in Britain. That will come as a nice surprise to British readers.

"每个人都去"[大学](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/04/05/the-university-lottery)，莎瑞尔女士在一段典型的泛泛之词中写道。实际上并非如此。而不参加大学教育，生活在离美国最特权地区较远的年轻人往往会感到担忧。青少年自杀率在像阿拉斯加和南达科他这样的州要高得多，而不是在加利福尼亚或纽约；在英国，北爱尔兰的自杀率也很高。看起来，这些地方的青少年不太可能受到特别多的智能手机、治疗师或宽容的父母的困扰。

“Everyone goes” to [university](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/04/05/the-university-lottery), writes Ms Shrier in a typically sweeping aside. They do not. And young people who do not attend university, who live far from the most privileged corners of America, are often the ones to worry about. The youth suicide rate is much higher in states like Alaska and South Dakota than it is in California or New York; in Britain, it is high in Northern Ireland. It seems unlikely that teenagers in such places are afflicted by a peculiarly large number of smartphones, therapists or permissive parents.

许多年轻人确实感到焦虑、不快乐或孤独。但确信他们的心理状态最为重要是当代的观念。以前的成年人对年轻人的精神关心较少，更多地关注他们的不端和任性行为。从这个标准来看，崛起的一代是天使般的。在美国，斗殴、青少年犯罪、吸毒和青少年怀孕率都在减少。

Many young people are certainly anxious, unhappy or lonely. But the conviction that their mental state matters above all is contemporary. Previous generations of adults cared less about young people’s minds than about their deviant and unruly behaviour. By such yardsticks, the rising generation is angelic. Fighting, juvenile crime, drug use and teenage pregnancy are all retreating in America.

与以往的一代相比，Z世代在其他方面表现更好。他们不容忍偏见：X世代的成员可能会想起，他们年轻时多少会怀疑他人的性取向或指责对方存在精神和身体残障。像莎瑞尔女士所称的那样将Z世代描述为希望与自我为中心是忽略了最近的历史。在2020年，为了拯救老年人免受新冠病毒的侵害，孩子们和青少年必须接受[非同寻常的痛苦限制](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/05/covid-19-was-a-disaster-for-the-worlds-schoolchildren)。

Generation Z improves on earlier cohorts in other ways. It is intolerant of prejudice: members of Generation X might care to recall how much of their youthful repertoire of insults questioned other people’s sexuality or pointed to mental and physical disabilities. To describe Gen Z as hopelessly self-involved, as Ms Shrier does, ignores recent history. Children and teenagers submitted to [extraordinary, painful restraints](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/12/05/covid-19-was-a-disaster-for-the-worlds-schoolchildren) in 2020 in order to save older people from covid.

如今年轻的一代最终会长大，找到工作，建立关系并且有孩子。如果过去是一个指南，他们会继续撰写批评年轻人的文章和书籍。在上世纪30年代，年轻人被视为对公共秩序的威胁；在80年代，他们长大得太快。如今他们成长得太慢，而且感到痛苦。对于尚未出生的一代会有什么样的评判呢？ ■

The generation that is now young will eventually grow up, get jobs, form relationships and have children. If the past is any guide, its members will proceed to write articles and books that find fault with young people. In the 1930s the young were seen as threats to public order; in the 1980s they were growing up too fast. Today they are growing up too slowly and are miserable. What judgment awaits a generation not yet born? ■

纽约第92街Y会庆祝150周年 (New York’s 92nd Street Y turns 150)
=================================================

它的改革为其他文化中心提供了借鉴。 (Its reinvention holds lessons for other cultural centres)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_CUP505.jpg)

**第92街Y**是一座文化殿堂，曾经举办过20世纪和21世纪一些最伟大的创意思想。特鲁曼·卡普特首次在那里公开讨论了他的小说《冷血杀人案》，而[Kurt Vonnegut](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2007/04/19/kurt-vonnegut)甚至在他妻子读之前发布了《冠军的早餐》。大提琴手**Yo-Yo Ma**在那里以少年之姿演奏过。文学巨匠[玛雅·安吉洛](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2014/06/07/maya-angelou)、詹姆斯·鲍德温、[T.S.艾略特](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/15/the-waste-land-is-a-case-study-of-great-art-by-flawed-artists)和迪伦·托马斯曾在这个舞台上闪耀。其他人也在这里表演过：现代舞编舞家[玛莎·格雷厄姆](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/02/01/martha-grahams-life-tracked-the-jumps-and-dips-of-modern-dance)和Alvin Ailey。

THE 92ND STREET Y is a temple of culture that has hosted some of the greatest creative minds of the 20th and 21st centuries. Truman Capote first publicly discussed his novel “In Cold Blood” there, and [Kurt Vonnegut](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2007/04/19/kurt-vonnegut) unveiled “Breakfast of Champions” before even his wife had read it. Yo-Yo Ma, a cellist, performed at the venue as a teenager. Literary greats [Maya Angelou](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2014/06/07/maya-angelou), James Baldwin, [T.S. Eliot](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/15/the-waste-land-is-a-case-study-of-great-art-by-flawed-artists) and Dylan Thomas have stridden across the stage. Others have pirouetted: [Martha Graham](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/02/01/martha-grahams-life-tracked-the-jumps-and-dips-of-modern-dance) and Alvin Ailey, modern-dance choreographers, put on performances.

第92街Y（在2022年更名为92NY）正在以人们所期望的方式庆祝其成立150周年：用一年的讲座、研讨会和其他活动。1874年3月22日，犹太商人和公民领袖们成立了它，最初名为“青年希伯来会”，旨在帮助从东欧抵达的犹太移民。当埃玛·拉萨鲁斯于1883年创作《新巨人》时，其中包含“给我你疲惫、你贫穷、你成群结队的人群”的一句，至今仍镌刻在自由女神像上，她当时正在92NY教授英语，帮助最近抵达的俄罗斯犹太移民。

The 92nd Street Y (which rebranded itself 92NY in 2022) is celebrating its 150th birthday in the style you might expect: with a year of talks, workshops and other events. Jewish business and civic leaders founded it on March 22nd 1874 as the Young Men’s Hebrew Association, with the goal of helping Jewish immigrants arriving from eastern Europe. When Emma Lazarus wrote “The New Colossus” in 1883—which contained the line “give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses”, still etched on the Statue of Liberty—she was teaching English to recently arrived Russian Jewish immigrants at the 92NY.

**92NY**已经创新，保持其相关性。在20世纪初，它开始向所有背景和信仰的人提供服务和丰富的项目。如今，它仍然作为一个社区中心，为儿童提供游泳和小提琴课程，为成年人开设鞋类制作课程，并且正在进行2亿美元的翻新。它创造了“Giving Tuesday”，现在被慈善机构的工作人员在全球范围内庆祝，他们利用这个时机向人们征求捐款。

92NY has innovated to stay relevant. In the early 1900s it started providing services and enrichment programmes to people of all backgrounds and beliefs. Today it still serves as a community centre, offering swimming and violin lessons to children and shoemaking classes to adults, and is in the throes of a $200m renovation. It invented “Giving Tuesday”, now celebrated worldwide by workers at charities, who use the occasion to ask people for donations.

对其他机构来说，要复制92NY的财富、人际网络和广泛的节目组合并不容易，尽管毫无疑问有许多人尝试过。但尽管92NY独特，但它正在面临其他社区团体也面临的两大挑战。

It is not easy for other institutions to replicate 92NY’s special mix of wealth, networks and breadth of programming that have made it so successful—though no doubt many have tried. But despite 92NY’s uniqueness, it is navigating two challenges that other community groups also face.

其中一个是如何在极化的气候中最好地处理信仰。哈马斯恐怖分子于10月7日杀害以色列人，这给92NY带来了让各种思想家登台的挑战。袭击后不久，一位曾批评以色列的普利策奖获得小说家[Viet Thanh Nguyen](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/03/20/a-second-novel-from-a-bard-of-the-refugee-experience)的朗读活动被推迟了。少数其他作者随后以支持的方式取消了92NY的活动，反对他们所称的审查制度。92NY决定暂时搁置其文学系列活动。

One is how to deal best with faith in a polarised climate. The murder of Israelis by Hamas terrorists on October 7th complicated 92NY’s goal of bringing diverse thinkers to the stage. Shortly after the attack it postponed a reading by [Viet Thanh Nguyen](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/03/20/a-second-novel-from-a-bard-of-the-refugee-experience), a Pulitzer-prizewinning novelist who had been critical of Israel. A handful of other authors then cancelled events at 92NY in solidarity, to oppose what they called censorship. 92NY decided to put its literary series on hold.

作为一家为非犹太人提供服务更多而非犹太人的犹太机构，92NY一直在努力把握平衡。其老板Seth Pinsky表示，92NY“是犹太社区代表世界的大使”，同时也满足“对意义”和“社区”的需求。这使得92NY“比历史上任何时候都更具相关性”。最近几个月，它既接待了以色列的批评者，也接待了支持者。与92NY一样，许多艺术团体都在努力平衡包容性和言论自由，路上不会一帆风顺。

As a Jewish institution that serves more non-Jews than Jews, 92NY has struggled to get the balance right. Seth Pinsky, its boss, says 92NY is “an ambassador to the world on behalf of the Jewish community” but also caters to “the need for meaning” and “community” generally. This makes 92NY “more relevant than we’ve ever been in our history”. In recent months it has hosted both critics and supporters of Israel. Like 92NY, many arts groups have tried to balance inclusivity and free speech, with bumps along the way.

92NY还必须面对另一个挑战：从一个拥有单一建筑内项目的著名场所转变为一个与纽约之外的人联系在一起的在线品牌。在这一点上，它取得了惊人的成功。大流行病迫使数字化转变。2019年，有13.8万人参加了92NY的活动或课程，全部都是亲自到场。去年，有15万人亲自到场，但此外，26%的门票和课程名额卖给了在线参与者。每8美元的销售额中，就有一美元来自数字渠道。截至2月份的一年里，92NY的在线数字内容被浏览了4400万次，其中约42%的浏览量来自美国以外的地区。

92NY has also had to confront another challenge: a transition from a renowned venue with programmes housed in a single building into an online brand with links to people outside New York. Here it has been succeeding spectacularly. The pandemic forced a digital pivot. In 2019 138,000 people attended an event or class at 92NY, all in person. Last year 150,000 people attended in person, but in addition, 26% of all tickets and places in classes were sold to online participants. One in every $8 of sales was generated from digital sources. In the year to February, there were 44m views of 92NY’s online digital content, which includes classes, concerts, archives and panel discussions. About 42% of the views came from outside America.

92NY也已成为其他文化团体的平台。克利夫兰艺术博物馆、布朗克斯动物园和波士顿伊莎贝拉·斯图尔特·加德纳博物馆等45个机构将自己的内容放在92NY的网站上。Pinsky先生表示，92NY的竞争对手是“每个人，也是没有人”。在未来几年，纽约之外的许多人都会听说92NY。■

92NY has become a platform for other cultural groups, too. The Cleveland Museum of Art, the Bronx Zoo and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston are among 45 institutions that put their content on the 92NY’s website. Mr Pinsky says 92NY’s competition is “everybody and nobody”. Plenty of somebodies outside New York will be hearing about 92NY in the years ahead. ■

恐龙化石的发现如何引发了一场革命 (How the discovery of dinosaur fossils caused a revolution)
=========================================================================

《不可能的怪物》探讨了改变人类思想的70年 (“Impossible Monsters” looks at 70 years that changed human thought)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Exhibit of Ichthyosaurus fossil discovered by Mary Anning on display at the Natural History Museum in London.](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240323_CUP502.jpg)

**不可能的怪兽。** 迈克尔·泰勒著。*波德利头；496页；25英镑。将于7月由利维赫特出版；32.99美元*

**Impossible Monsters.** By Michael Taylor. *Bodley Head; 496 pages; £25. To be published in America by Liveright in July; $32.99*

1811年，一个智识革命开始了，当时一个名为玛丽·安宁的12岁女孩，生活在英格兰西南部的港口城镇莱姆瑞吉斯，首次发掘了一种海洋爬行动物――***鱼龙***的第一件化石。这一革命在1881年达到高潮，当时理查德·欧文在世界帝国的首都伦敦开设了自然历史博物馆。这七十年间经历了一场思想变革，其深远程度与文艺复兴晚期的天文学家引发的变革相当，也令当时的教会陷入困境（这次受到威胁的是英格兰教会，而非罗马教会）。***化石***引发了一个具有圣经意义的启示：上帝并非在几千年前的六天创造了世界，正如许多人所信奉的那样。

AN intellectual revolution began in 1811 when Mary Anning, a 12-year-old living in Lyme Regis, a harbour town in south-west England, [excavated the first fossil](https://www.economist.com/1843/2017/07/31/jurassic-art) of a marine reptile, the *Ichthyosaurus*. It culminated in 1881 with the opening of the Natural History Museum in London, imperial capital of the world, by Richard Owen. Those seven decades spanned a change in thinking as profound as that triggered by the astronomers of the late Renaissance—and as disturbing to the established church. (In this case, the threatened church was that of England, not Rome.) [Fossils](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/05/17/the-market-for-dinosaur-fossils-is-booming) sparked a revelation of biblical proportions: God had not created the world in six days a few thousand years before, as so many believed.

“不可能的怪兽”讲述了一个有关时间的故事――或者说，两个平行的故事。在其中一个故事中，时间向前推移，参与者轮流做出引人瞩目的发现，帮助推动科学的进步和人类对自己在世界中的位置的理解。在另一个故事中，时间向后流动，地质学家和博物学家所需的年数从数千年增长到数十万年，再到数百万年，推迟了“创世纪”的日期。

“Impossible Monsters” is a story about time—or, rather, two parallel stories. In one, time moves forward, as the players take turns making remarkable discoveries that help advance science and humans’ understanding of their place in the world. In the second, it moves backwards, as the years needed to accommodate the findings of geologists and naturalists expand from thousands, to hundreds of thousands, to millions, pushing the date of “Creation” further away.

在撰写“不可能的怪兽”时，历史学家迈克尔·泰勒的任务是要比以往更好地讲述一个被反复讲述的故事。他非常成功。书中出场的人物众多且千姿百态，包括安宁（如图所示），一个卖化石的低微女性，通过她的发现，获得了国际声誉――*鱼龙*只是第一个――但她因性别原因被拒绝加入皇家地质学会。许多人具有独特且令人难以忘怀的特点，比如威廉·巴克兰德，一个古怪的牛津教授，曾吃下路易十四心脏的木乃伊碎片。他更为人所铭记的是识别并命名了***巨龙兽***，随后被称为“恐龙”的第一种。

In writing “Impossible Monsters”, the task of Michael Taylor, a historian, was to tell a much-told tale better than it had been told before. He has succeeded splendidly. The cast is many and varied, including Anning (pictured), a lowly fossil-seller, who achieved international fame through her discoveries—*Ichthyosaurus* was but the first—yet was barred from joining the Royal Geological Society because of her sex. Many are memorably idiosyncratic, such as William Buckland, an eccentric Oxford don who once ate a mummified morsel of Louis XIV’s heart. He is better remembered for identifying and naming *Megalosaurus*, the first of the group subsequently dubbed “dinosaurs”.

一些人物众所周知，比如查尔斯·达尔文（无需介绍，除非您生活在他的理论被从教科书中禁止的地方）。但许多人物不太为人所熟知，比如阿尔弗雷德·拉塞尔·华莱士，一个热带标本的收集者和销售者，他独立构想了自然选择的观念。达尔文的自封“牛犬”的托马斯·赫胥黎，成为了维多利亚时代英国所有事务官方和科学事务的首席推动者和影响者。欧文是赫胥黎的敌人，坚持反对达尔文的观点，但却推动了许多人现在视为进化的殿堂的博物馆的建设。

Some of the characters are familiar, like [Charles Darwin](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2009/01/22/a-natural-selection) (no introduction needed, unless you live somewhere [his theory](https://www.economist.com/erasmus/2019/02/12/many-people-still-reject-charles-darwins-theory-of-evolution) is banned from textbooks). But many are less well known, such as Alfred Russel Wallace, a collector and seller of tropical specimens, who devised the idea of natural selection independently. [Thomas Huxley](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/10/06/thomas-and-julian-huxley-were-champions-of-darwinism), Darwin’s self-appointed “bulldog”, became chief mover and shaker for all things official and scientific in Victorian Britain. Owen, Huxley’s enemy, held out against Darwin’s ideas, yet forced through the construction of the museum many now regard as evolution’s temple.

这是一个雄伟的视觉盛宴。但泰勒先生也表达了相信并传播与人们在寻找标本的岩石和热带雨林中联系在一起的新观点是多么冒险的感觉。一些传教士，其中包括巴克兰等人，通过智力上的扭曲来调和这些骨头与圣经。甚至是达尔文，富有并有良好社会关系（并且曾被预定加入教会），起初也害怕如果他的观点公之于众可能带来的耻辱。

It is a grand pageant. But Mr Taylor also conveys a sense of just how risky it was to believe in and promulgate the new ideas tied to the rocks and tropical forests where people hunted for specimens. Some clergymen, Buckland among them, performed intellectual contortions to reconcile the bones with the Bible. Even Darwin, wealthy and well-connected (and at one point himself destined for the church), at first lived in fear of the disgrace that might accrue if his ideas became public.

当然，智识氛围发生了变化。然而，为了不让读者在他们的启蒙之中过于自得，考虑到书的序言中提到的詹姆斯·厄舍，他是17世纪生活在英格兰和爱尔兰的总主教。厄舍致力于计算上帝创造世界的确切日期。与一些19世纪的教会继承人不同，他无法被指责忽视或扭曲证据。他花费数十年时间和一大笔财富收集灰尘飘扬的古籍，认为这给他提供了将圣经段落锚定在时间轴上所需的数据点，就像现代地质学家可能使用火山灰层的放射性证据来为地层定年一样。

The intellectual climate changed, of course. However, lest readers congratulate themselves too readily on their enlightenment, it is salutary to consider, as the book’s prologue does, the case of James Ussher, an Anglo-Irish archbishop who lived in the 17th century. Ussher devoted his life to calculating the exact date of God’s creation of the world. Unlike some of his 19th-century ecclesiastical successors, he cannot be accused of ignoring or twisting the evidence. He spent decades and a fortune assembling dusty tomes that gave him what he thought were the data points he needed to anchor biblical passages in time, just as a modern geologist might use the radiometric evidence of volcanic-ash layers to date a series of strata.

厄舍的结论是世界始于公元前4004年10月22日。这个观念听起来几乎像一件古老的化石。但谁又知道今天广泛接受的一些观念将来也会灭绝呢？ ■

Ussher’s conclusion was that the world began on October 22nd 4004BC. It is an idea that sounds almost as prehistoric as a fossil. But who knows what widely accepted notions of today will also go extinct? ■
