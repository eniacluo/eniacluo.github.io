我们看世界的方式 (How we saw the world)

**人工智能能够改变医疗保健吗？** 这是本周《[科技季刊](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2024-03-30)》的核心问题，由我们的健康编辑纳塔莎·洛德尔撰写，并被放在了《经济学人》美国和亚洲的封面上。

Can artificial intelligence transform health care? That is the question at the heart of this week’s [Technology Quarterly](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2024-03-30), written by our health editor, Natasha Loder, and which we featured on our cover in America and Asia.

我们最初的想法是在后景中插入一枚芯片来诠释《维特鲁威人》。正如你所看到的，莱昂纳多·达·芬奇在本周的报纸中随处可见：他也是《蒙娜丽莎》的幕后功臣。

Our first idea was to illustrate the Vitruvian man with a chip in the background. As you can see, Leonardo da Vinci is all over this week’s paper: he was also the hand behind the Mona Lisa.

我们认为封面应该与《科技季刊》有关。人工智能正在各处引起兴奋和夸大，但在医疗保健领域，它可能具有革命性潜力。正如《科技季刊》描述的那样，它承诺提供更好的诊断、为患者提供定制支持、加快药物发现以及提高效率。在欧洲，分析师预测，它每年能够拯救数十万人的生命。

We thought that our cover should refer to the TQ. Artificial intelligence is generating excitement and hyperbole everywhere, but in health care it has the potential to be transformational. As the TQ describes, it promises better diagnoses, personalised support for patients, faster drug discovery and greater efficiency. In Europe analysts predict that it could save hundreds of thousands of lives each year.

**Leader:** [The AI doctor will see you…eventually](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/27/the-ai-doctor-will-see-youeventually)**Technology Quarterly:** [A new prescription](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2024-03-30)

本周在欧洲的封面上，我们探讨了对欧洲经济构成的三次严重冲击，实际的和潜在的。部分原因是随着俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后伴随的能源价格上涨，欧盟的国内生产总值在本十年内仅增长了4%，而美国则为8%。更糟糕的是，欧洲面临着来自中国的廉价进口激增。而且在一年之内，唐纳德·特朗普可能会重新入主白宫，并对欧洲的出口征收巨额关税。

On our cover in Europe this week we looked at three severe shocks, actual and potential, to the continent’s economy. Partly because of the jump in energy prices that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the European Union’s GDP has grown by only 4% this decade, compared with 8% in America. As if that were not bad enough, Europe faces a surge of cheap imports from China. And within a year Donald Trump could be back in the White House, slapping huge tariffs on Europe’s exports.

我们最初的想法是用一朵凋零的带有欧元硬币的蓝色花朵来描绘即将到来的灾难。欧洲的不幸时机特别不妙。美国对乌克兰的支持已经消失，能源转型还有更多要做。迅速老龄化的人口、过度严格的监管和市场一体化不足继续阻碍增长。对失望的欧洲选民而言，他们越来越可能支持像德国选择之路党这样的极右翼政党。

Our first idea was to illustrate the impending blight with a flower with rotting blue petals and a euro coin. Europe’s misfortune is particularly ill-timed. American support for Ukraine has dried up and the energy transition has much further to run. A fast-ageing population, overbearing regulators and inadequate market integration continue to hold back growth. Disillusioned European voters are increasingly liable to support hard-right parties such as the Alternative for Germany.

但这幅图像暗示我们正在讨论单一货币区域内的20个国家。而实际上，这些冲击威胁整个欧洲，包括英国在内。

But the image implies that we are writing about the 20 countries in the single currency. In reality, the shocks threaten the entire continent—including Britain.

第二个主意如何？一张皱巴巴的欧元纸币呢？不知怎的，这个形象不局限于货币联盟。相反，它暗示了我们想在社论中突出的第四个危险。尽管欧洲面临的冲击是无法控制的，但欧洲自身政策制定者的错误却可能会严重加剧损失。

How about our second idea, a crumpled euro note? Somehow, the image is not limited to the currency union. Instead it hints at a fourth danger that we wanted to be a central part of our leader. Although the shocks facing Europe are outside its control, errors from Europe’s own policymakers could greatly aggravate the damage.

我们还考虑过一个古典典故——一尊有着缠绕下行红箭的人像雕塑——因为欧洲对于保留产业和就业的理解，虽然理所当然，却是向过去看齐的冲动的一部分。

We also thought about a classical allusion—a sculpture of a man with a red arrow wrapped around it, pointing downwards—because those errors stem partly from Europe’s understandable but backward-looking urge to preserve industries and jobs.

一个错误将是在脆弱时期保持经济政策过于紧缩，以应对通货紧缩的先前战争。如果中央银行保持经济远离崩溃，这将使失业工人更容易找到新工作，也更容易应对外部的干扰。

One error would be to fight the previous war against inflation by keeping economic policy too tight at a moment of vulnerability. It will be easier to cope with disruption from outside if central banks keep the economy out of a slump that would stop displaced workers finding new jobs.

另一个错误将是效仿美国和中国的保护主义，向重点行业提供巨额补贴。中国最近的经济困境证明了过度政府计划的缺陷，而非优点。

Another error would be to copy America’s and China’s protectionism by giving vast subsidies to favoured industries. China’s recent economic woes demonstrate the flaws, not the virtues, of excessive government planning.

不幸的是，看起来雕塑正与官僚红绳搏斗。古典形象不错，但我们想要更加精确的东西。

Unfortunately, it looked as if the sculpture was grappling with red tape. Classical imagery was good, but we wanted something more precise.

当我们看到《蒙娜丽莎》的形象时，我们知道我们找到了我们想要的。她不仅遭受了严重打击；同时也摇身一变成为庞克风。这象征着欧洲需要抛弃过去，打造自己与时俱进的经济政策。

When we saw the image of Mona Lisa, we knew we had what we were after. She has not only received a nasty shock; she’s also gone punk. And that nods towards Europe’s need to junk the past and forge its own, up-to-the-moment economic policy.

即使美国向产业大肆投入公共资金，欧洲应该选择在基础设施、教育、研发上投资。而不是效仿中国的干预主义，欧洲应该注意到中国企业从庞大的国内市场中获益。整合欧洲服务市场，加强贸易仍然困难的领域，将有助于企业发展、奖励创新，并取代一些失去的制造业工作。

Even as America showers industry with public money, Europe should instead spend on infrastructure, education, and research and development. Rather than emulate China’s interventionism, Europe should note the benefit Chinese firms derive from a vast domestic market. Integrating Europe’s market for services, where trade remains difficult, would help firms grow, reward innovation and replace some lost manufacturing jobs.

引人注目的封面几乎准备完毕，但我们中的一些人希望将三重冲击与我们的现代《蒙娜丽莎》联系起来。因此，我们的设计师想出在她的左肩上方加上一些火箭。他们说闪电不会两次击中同一地方。但这次却威胁着欧洲三次。

The hair-raising cover was almost ready, but some of us wanted to tie in the triple shock with our modern Mona Lisa. So our designers came up with some firebolts over her left shoulder. They say lightning never strikes twice. It threatens to strike Europe three times.

政治 (Politics)
==========

都在讲象征意义 (It’s all about the symbolism)
-----------------------------------

![在莫斯科郊外的克拉斯诺戈尔斯克，烧毁的郁金香城市音乐厅留下了鲜花](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_WWP002.jpg)

持枪歹徒袭击了**莫斯科**附近的一家音乐厅，造成至少139人死亡。 这是俄罗斯自2004年别斯兰学校围攻以来发生的最致命恐怖袭击事件。 伊斯兰国在中亚的分支声称对此负责。据称来自塔吉克斯坦的四名被告在遭受严重挫伤和殴打的情况下出庭面对恐怖主义指控。当局称这些人来自塔吉克斯坦。莫斯科的美国大使馆在三月初曾警告可能发生袭击，告诉其公民避免参加大型聚会。俄罗斯却忽视了这一警告。**弗拉基米尔·普京**和俄罗斯媒体试图将袭击与乌克兰联系在一起，而不顾事实。一家电视频道播放了乌克兰官员对该事件感到得意的伪视频片段。

Gunmen attacked [a concert hall near Moscow](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/27/vladimir-putin-blames-an-islamist-attack-on-ukraine-and-america), killing at least 139 people. It was **Russia’s** deadliest terrorist incident since the Beslan school siege in 2004. An affiliate of Islamic State in Central Asia claimed responsibility. Four of the alleged attackers appeared in court, severely bruised and beaten, to face charges of terrorism. The authorities say the men are from Tajikistan. The American embassy in Moscow had warned of an attack in early March, telling its citizens to avoid large gatherings. Russia ignored the warning. Vladimir Putin and Russian media have instead brazenly tried to link the attack to Ukraine. One television channel aired fake video clips of a Ukrainian official crowing over the incident.

**俄罗斯**加剧了对**乌克兰**的无人机和导弹袭击，这些袭击在莫斯科发生IS袭击之前不久升级。乌克兰首都基辅遭受袭击，全国各地的能源基础设施也成为袭击目标。当一枚俄罗斯导弹误入波兰领空时，波兰立即起飞战斗机。

Russia intensified its drone and missile assaults on **Ukraine**, stepping them up shortly before the IS attack in Moscow. Kyiv, the capital, was hit and energy infrastructure targeted across the country. Poland scrambled fighter jets when a Russian missile strayed into its air space.

**保加利亚**似乎正走向另一次选举，这将是该国三年内的第六次选举，因为保加利亚的政党未能就“团结”政府达成一致，这威胁着保加利亚在2025年初采用欧元作为其货币的努力。 极右派和亲俄派政党正在壮大。

**Bulgaria** seemed to be heading towards another election, its sixth in three years, as the country’s political parties failed to agree on a “unity” government, threatening Bulgaria’s attempt to adopt the euro as its currency in early 2025. Far-right and pro-Russian parties are gaining ground.

西蒙·哈里斯被选为**爱尔兰**的新新民主党领袖，并将在**雷欧·瓦拉德卡**辞职后成为该国总理。37岁的哈里斯先生将成为担任该职位的最年轻的人。

Simon Harris was chosen as the new leader of Fine Gael in **Ireland** and is set to become the country’s prime minister following the resignation of Leo Varadkar. Aged 37, Mr Harris will be the youngest person to hold the position.

联合国安理会通过一项决议，要求**以色列**和哈马斯在剩下的斋月期间实行临时停火，此举得到了美国的棄權支持，而美国此前曾使用否决权阻止三项旨在停止加沙战斗的决议。由于美国的棄權，以色列对原定访问华盛顿的代表团进行了取消，并表示不会在哈马斯仍然扣押以色列人质的情况下停止军事行动。

The UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding a temporary ceasefire between **Israel** and Hamas for the remainder of Ramadan, aided by the abstention of America, which had used its veto to block three earlier resolutions calling for a halt to the fighting in Gaza. Angered by America’s abstention, Israel cancelled a planned visit by a delegation to Washington and said it would not halt operations while Hamas still holds Israeli hostages.

**塞内加尔**选民纷纷前往投票站，选举反对派候选人**巴西鲁·迪奥迈·费耶**为总统。现任总统Macky Sall曾试图推迟选举，导致宪法危机持续。

Voters in **[Senegal](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/26/senegal-proves-the-doomsayers-wrong)** turned out in large numbers to elect Bassirou Diomaye Faye, the opposition candidate, as president. Macky Sall, the outgoing president, had tried to postpone the election, causing a protracted constitutional crisis.

**[南非](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/21/jacob-zumas-new-party-could-swing-south-africas-election)**的一家法院裁定，由南非前总统雅各布·祖马支持的政党可以参加定于五月底举行的大选。根据最近的民意调查，uMkhonto we Sizwe党可能获得超过10%的选票，可能会迫使执政的非洲人国民大会获得约40%的选票，如若希望组建政府，还需寻求与他人的合作。

A court in **[South Africa](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/03/21/jacob-zumas-new-party-could-swing-south-africas-election)** ruled that a party backed by Jacob Zuma, a former president, can be on the ballot in the general election scheduled for the end of May. The uMkhonto we Sizwe party may get more than 10% of the vote, according to recent polls, which could push the ruling African National Congress to around 40%, forcing it to seek a coalition if it wishes to form a government.

美国、英国和新西兰指责中国发动了一场针对各种目标的**网络间谍活动**，包括英国选举委员会、新西兰议会和中国共产党批评者。美国和英国对一群中国黑客的涉嫌前端公司进行制裁。他们还对该组织的两名疑犯实施制裁，美国对他们和另外五名男子提起了刑事诉讼。

America, Britain and New Zealand blamed China for a **[cyber-espionage campaign](https://www.economist.com/china/2024/03/26/what-to-make-of-chinas-massive-cyber-espionage-campaign)** aimed at a variety of targets, including Britain’s Electoral Commission, New Zealand’s Parliament and critics of the Chinese Communist Party. America and Britain placed sanctions on an alleged front company for one group of Chinese hackers. They also placed sanctions on two alleged members of the group, while America brought criminal charges against them and five other men.

英国高等法院为**朱利安·阿桑奇**争取了更多时间，以对抗将其引渡到美国面临间谍指控，裁定美国政府必须就审判公平性等方面提供更多保证。阿桑奇在其维基解密网站上泄露了大量机密信息，美国称此举危及生命。

The High Court in Britain gave **Julian Assange** more time to fight against his extradition to America to face espionage charges, ruling that the American government had to provide more assurances about the fairness of a trial there, among other things. Mr Assange leaked a trove of classified information on his WikiLeaks site that the Americans say put lives in danger.

**[委内瑞拉](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/03/27/nicolas-maduros-sham-election-the-sequel)**主要反对派联盟的候选人被拒绝在七月的总统选举中注册，并错过了注册截止日期。80岁的哲学家Corina Yoris在最后一刻被拉来顶替已被捕的高级反对派人物。去年，玛利亚·科里娜·马查多赢得了反对派初选，但被最高法院禁止参选。

The candidate of **[Venezuela’s](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/03/27/nicolas-maduros-sham-election-the-sequel)** main opposition coalition was blocked from registering for July’s presidential election and missed the deadline. Corina Yoris, an 80-year-old philosopher, had been drafted in at the last minute following the arrest of senior opposition figures. María Corina Machado won the opposition primary last year by a landslide, but was prohibited from running by the Supreme Court.

美国国务院表示，他们正在关注**印度**的法律发展，此前德里首席部长兼资深反对派政治人物[阿尔温德·凯杰里瓦尔](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/03/27/arvind-kejriwals-imprisonment-is-a-stain-on-indias-democracy)被拘留。凯杰里瓦尔的逮捕发生在大选即将开始之前的几周。他因与德里的酒精政策相关的贪污案受审讯，他称这是“捏造的”。

America’s State Department said it was tracking legal developments in **India** after the arrest of [Arvind Kejriwal](https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/03/27/arvind-kejriwals-imprisonment-is-a-stain-on-indias-democracy), the chief minister of Delhi and a senior opposition politician. Mr Kejriwal’s arrest comes just weeks before the start of a general election. He was taken into custody for questioning over a corruption case relating to Delhi’s alcohol policy, which he says is “fabricated”.

美国和**日本**正准备加强两国的军事联盟，具体细节将于日本首相岸田文雄于4月10日访问白宫时公布。该计划包括重组指挥链，以便推动国防规划。与此同时，日本内阁敲定了一项协议，出售与英国和意大利合作研制的战斗机给其他国家，进一步削弱了日本的和平主义立场。

America and **Japan** are preparing to strengthen their military alliance, the details of which will be announced when Kishida Fumio, Japan’s prime minister, visits the White House on April 10th. The plan includes a restructuring of the command chain that will smooth defence planning. Meanwhile, the Japanese cabinet sealed a deal to sell fighter jets that are being developed with Britain and Italy to other countries, further eroding Japan’s pacifist stance.

**泰国**议会下议院以压倒性多数票通过了合法化同性婚姻以及遗产权等权利的法案。这项法案是政府的首要任务。如预期那样，上议院和国王批准该法律后，该法案将于今年年底生效，使泰国成为东南亚第一个合法化同性婚姻的国家。

The lower house of **Thailand’s** parliament voted overwhelmingly to legalise same-sex marriage and equalise rights on inheritance and so on. The bill is a priority for the government. If, as expected, the upper house and the king approve the law it will come into force by the end of the year, making Thailand the first country in South-East Asia to legalise gay nuptials.

乔·拜登签署了1.2万亿美元的**支出措施**计划法案，此前共和党人和民主党人再次在最后一刻达成协议以避免政府关门。这项立法本应在六个月前通过。美国众议院的叛逆共和党人再次提出罢免议长的可能性。

Joe Biden signed a $1.2trn package of **spending measures** into law, after Republicans and Democrats yet again reached a last-minute deal to avoid a government shutdown. The legislation should have been passed six months ago. Rebellious Republicans in the House of Representatives yet again raised the possibility of ousting the speaker.

![法兰西斯·斯科特·凯桥的钢框架坐落在巴尔的摩, 马里兰的集装箱船达利上，桥梁倒塌](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_WWP001.jpg)

在**[巴尔的摩](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/26-the-impact-of-the-baltimore-bridge-disaster)**，法兰西斯·斯科特·凯桥在一艘集装箱船与其支撑柱之一相撞后倒塌。 六名位于桥上的工人坠入下方水中失去生命。 巴尔的摩港是美国东海岸贸易的枢纽，将被破坏数月。

The Francis Scott Key Bridge in **[Baltimore](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/26/the-impact-of-the-baltimore-bridge-disaster)** collapsed after a container ship collided with one of its support columns. Six workers who were on the bridge died after falling into the water below. The port of Baltimore, a hub for trade on America’s east coast, will be disrupted for months.

上诉法院同意**唐纳德·特朗普**的请求，只支付其在一起民事诈骗审判中被裁定的4.54亿美元罚款的一部分。 法院告知特朗普他可以在对原判做出上诉期间缴纳1.75亿美元的保证金。然而，特朗普的喘息时间很短暂。不久之后，一名法官否决了他推迟就支付给一名色情明星的封口费而进行的刑事审判的请求。该审判将于4月15日开始。

An appeals court agreed to **Donald Trump’s** request to pay just a portion of the $454m penalty awarded against him in a civil fraud trial. The court told Mr Trump he could post a bond of $175m while he appeals against the original judgment. Mr Trump’s relief was short-lived, however. Soon after, a judge denied his plea to delay his criminal trial over hush-money payments to a porn star. The trial starts on April 15th.

特朗普先生可能会从他在纳斯达克交易所的社交媒体公司股票出售中获得一些现金。**真实社交**的股价在首日交易中上涨了16%，使特朗普先生持有的股份价值约46亿美元。

Mr Trump may be able to scrape some cash from the sale of stock in his social-media company on the Nasdaq exchange. **Truth Social’s** share price rose by 16% on its first day of trading, making Mr Trump’s stake worth around $4.6bn.

债务束缚 (Trussed up in debt)
----------------------

![波音公司的标志在法恩堡国际航空展上展示](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_WWP501.jpg)

**波音**高层管理层在投资者对其客机安全检查感到不安时进行了全面调整。一月份，一块面板从一架737 Max 9客机上掉落，不久后就在起飞后不久。此后报道了几起事故，包括一架777客机在起飞时失去一个着陆轮胎。波音的安全问题已成为TikTok上的话题。Dave Calhoun将在年底辞去首席执行官职务，Larry Kellner将辞去主席职位。商用飞机部门的负责人立即被更换。

The top ranks of **[Boeing’s](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/25/dave-calhoun-bows-out-as-chief-executive-of-boeing)** management were overhauled amid investor unease about safety checks on its airliners. In January a panel fell from a 737 Max 9 passenger jet soon after take-off. Several incidents have been reported since then, including a 777 that lost a landing-gear tyre when it was taking off. Boeing safety has become a meme on TikTok. Dave Calhoun is to step down as chief executive by the end of the year and Larry Kellner departs as chairman. The head of the commercial-aircraft division has been replaced with immediate effect.

美国司法部对**苹果**提起了反垄断诉讼，指控这家科技巨头加大了顾客更换手机的难度，破坏了应用创新，并对开发者、企业和消费者造成了“巨大成本”。这项诉讼实质上试图阻止苹果将用户锁定在其生态系统中。苹果表示该诉讼“威胁了我们作为公司的本质”，并为“赋予政府权力在设计人们的技术方面采取强硬措施”设立了“危险先例”。此案将需要数年时间在法庭审理中解决。

America’s Justice Department lodged an antitrust lawsuit against **[Apple](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/22/the-department-of-justice-wages-war-on-apple)**, accusing the tech giant of making it harder for customers to switch phones, undermining innovation in apps, and imposing “extraordinary costs” on developers, businesses and consumers. The complaint in effect attempts to stop Apple locking users into its ecosystem. Apple said the suit “threatens who we are” as a company and sets “a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology”. The case will take years to wind its way through the courts.

与此同时，欧盟对Alphabet和苹果在其应用商店的竞争行为以及Meta在广告中使用个人信息展开了调查。这是欧盟根据新的**数字市场法**首次对科技公司进行正式审查。欧盟的反垄断专员表示，“如果这些问题是通过‘简单讨论’与公司解决的，它们早就该解决了”。

Meanwhile, the European Union opened investigations into Alphabet and Apple over competition practices at their app stores, and Meta over its use of personal information in advertising. It is the first official scrutiny of tech companies under the EU’s new **Digital Markets Act**. Had the issues been resolved with the companies by “mere discussion, they would have been solved by now”, said the EU’s antitrust commissioner.

**阿里巴巴**放弃了计划中的物流部门IPO，而是提议收购该业务的少数股东。一年前，这家中国科技巨头宣布打算分拆为六个部分，每个部门都有可能进行上市。但这一计划并未激发投资者的兴趣。去年底，阿里巴巴决定不拆分其云计算部门，并暂停了其超市部门的IPO。

**Alibaba** abandoned a planned IPO for its logistics division, instead offering to buy out minority shareholders in the business. A year ago the Chinese tech giant announced its intention to split into six parts, with the potential for each to pursue a stockmarket listing. But the plan hasn’t excited investors. Late last year Alibaba decided not to spin off its cloud unit and suspended the IPO of its supermarket arm.

**Reddit**的股价从在纽约证券交易所成功上市中获得的收益中保持了大部分涨幅。这家社交媒体平台的股价首日上涨了48%。

**Reddit’s** share price held on to most of the gains reaped from its successful flotation on the New York Stock Exchange. The social-media platform’s stock soared by 48% on the first day of trading.

**日元**兑美元跌至34年低点，引发了日本官员的警告，称他们可能会干预货币市场。日本央行最近自2007年以来首次提高了利率，这通常会导致日元走强，但其货币政策仍然相对宽松。

The **yen** fell to a 34-year low against the dollar, triggering warnings from Japanese officials that they might intervene in the currency markets. The Bank of Japan raised interest rates recently for the first time since 2007, which would normally cause the yen to strengthen, but its monetary policy remains comparatively loose.

华盛顿的非党派国会预算办公室主任再次发出警告，称美国面临着**联邦债务**的迫在眉睫危机，该债务在2023年底达到26万亿美元，占GDP的97%。Phillip Swagel提出了一个可能性，即市场可能会失去对美国偿还债务能力的信心，这种情况类似于2022年10月英国的Liz Truss政府面临的情况。今年早些时候，Swagel先生表示美国已经进入了“逐渐恶化”的债务和同时债务支付的恶性循环。

The director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in Washington repeated his warning that America faced a looming crisis on its **federal debt**, which stood at $26trn, or 97% of GDP, at the end of 2023. Phillip Swagel raised the possibility that markets could lose confidence in America’s ability to repay debt, similar to the situation that the government of Liz Truss faced in Britain in October 2022. Earlier this year Mr Swagel said that America had entered “a slow spiral” of rising debt and concurrent debt payments.

**土耳其**央行出乎市场意料地将其主要利率上调了5个百分点，至50%。一年前，该利率为8.5%。随着通胀逼近年度70%，央行表示将保持紧缩的货币政策，直到出现“显著和持续的价格下降”。

**Turkey’s** central bank surprised markets by lifting its main interest rate by five percentage points, to 50%. The rate was 8.5% a year ago. With inflation nearing 70% on an annual basis, the bank said it would retain a tight monetary policy until a “significant and sustained decline” in price rises was observed.

英国政府不再是英国国民银行集团的控股股东，将其持股降至刚好低于定义其为控股股东的30%门槛。在2008年的金融危机期间，政府拯救了**苏格兰皇家银行**以防其倒闭。在2020年，苏格兰皇家银行更名为英国国民银行集团（以RBS和NatWest品牌提供零售银行业务）。金融危机过去16年后，政府仍然预计英国国民银行集团直到2026年才会完全私有化。

The British government is no longer the controlling shareholder in NatWest Group, having reduced its stake to just below the 30% threshold that would define it as such. During the financial crisis of 2008 the government bailed out **Royal Bank of Scotland** to save it from collapse. In 2020 RBS was renamed NatWest Group (providing retail banking under the RBS and NatWest brands). Sixteen years after the crisis, the government still doesn’t expect NatWest Group to be fully private until 2026.

**Visa**和**万事达卡**同意在美国限制信用卡刷卡费，结束了与零售商长达20年的纠纷，可能能够为商家节省300亿美元的费用。该协议还允许零售商向客户收取在收银台使用信用卡的费用，并引导他们选择更为便宜的选项。

**Visa** and **Mastercard** agreed to cap credit-card swipe fees in America, ending a two-decade battle with retailers and potentially saving merchants $30bn over five years. The deal also allows retailers to charge customers for using the credit cards at tills while guiding them towards cheaper options.

一位法官驳回了X对Countering Digital Hate中心的诉讼，后者被控据称在从该平台上撤离广告商的活动中进行了一场宣传。Countering Digital Hate发表了一份报告，声称**推特上的仇恨言论**有所增加，随后其所有者埃隆·马斯克将其描述为危言耸听。但在一份尖锐的裁决中，法官发现这个案件完全是为了“惩罚被告的言论”。

A judge threw out a lawsuit brought by X against the Centre for Countering Digital Hate for allegedly conducting a campaign to drive advertisers away from the platform. CCDH published a report purporting to show a rise in **hate speech on Twitter**, as it then was, which Elon Musk, its owner, described as scaremongering. But in a scathing decision, the judge found that the case had been all about “punishing the defendants for their speech”.

欧洲经济面临的三重冲击 (The triple shock facing Europe’s economy)
===================================================

能源危机之后，欧洲面临中国进口激增和特朗普关税威胁。 (After the energy crisis, Europe faces surging Chinese imports and the threat of Trump tariffs)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![摩纳·丽莎，她的头发疯狂地竖立着](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_LDD001_FH.jpg)

**欧洲**并不以其活力而闻名，但如今从任何标准来看都显得停滞不前。受到俄罗斯于2022年入侵乌克兰后引发的能源震荡困扰，**欧盟**[经济](https://www.economist.com/economy)在本十年仅增长了4%，而美国则增长了8%；自2022年底以来，欧洲和英国都未实现增长。如果这还不够糟糕，欧洲面临来自中国的廉价进口激增，虽然使消费者受益，却可能损害制造商，加剧社会和工业纷争。未来一年内，唐纳德·特朗普可能重返白宫，对欧洲的出口征收[巨额关税](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/03/26/europes-economy-is-under-attack-from-all-sides)。

EUROPE IS not known for its dynamism, but today it looks stagnant by any standard. Frazzled by the energy shock that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the European Union’s [economy](https://www.economist.com/economy) has grown by only 4% this decade, compared with 8% in America; since the end of 2022, neither it nor Britain has grown at all. If that were not bad enough, Europe faces a surge of cheap imports from China which, while benefiting consumers, could harm manufacturers and increase social and industrial strife. And within a year Donald Trump could be back in the White House, slapping [huge tariffs](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/03/26/europes-economy-is-under-attack-from-all-sides) on Europe’s exports.

**欧洲**之不幸的时机不妙。这片大陆需要强劲的增长来帮助筹集更多国防开支，尤其是由于美国对乌克兰的支持已经枯竭，以及实现其绿色能源目标。其选民日益感到幻灭，可能会支持类似德国选择的这类极右翼党派。而长期以来拖累增长的因素——人口快速老龄化、繁杂的监管机构和不足的市场一体化——依然存在。

The timing of Europe’s misfortune is bad. The continent needs strong growth in order to help fund more defence spending, especially since American support for Ukraine has dried up, and to meet its green-energy goals. Its voters are increasingly disillusioned and liable to back hard-right parties such as the Alternative for Germany. And long-standing drags on growth—a fast-ageing population, overbearing regulators and inadequate market integration—have not gone away.

**欧洲**各国政府正在疯狂活动，试图做出回应。他们必须小心。尽管**欧洲**面临的冲击源自国外，但**欧洲**内部政策制定者的错误可能大大加剧损害。

There is a frenzy of activity in European capitals as governments try to respond. They must take care. Although the shocks facing Europe originate abroad, errors from Europe’s own policymakers could greatly aggravate the damage.

好消息是，能源震荡已经过了最痛苦的时刻：天然气价格已大幅下跌。不幸的是，其他问题才刚刚开始。面临通缩放缓，中国政府应该刺激全国稀缺的家庭消费，这将取代房地产投资成为需求的来源。但是，习近平主席却通过补贴来强化中国制造业，后者已占到全球商品制造的约三分之一。他依赖外国消费者来支撑增长。

The good news is that the energy shock is past the moment of maximum pain: gas prices have fallen far from their peak. Unfortunately the others are just beginning. Faced with a deflationary slowdown, China’s government should be stimulating the country’s paltry household consumption, which could replace property investment as a source of demand. Instead President Xi Jinping is using subsidies to supercharge Chinese manufacturing, which already accounts for about a third of global goods production. He is relying on foreign consumers to prop up growth.

中国的焦点是绿色商品，最为重要的是电动汽车，到2030年其在全球市场份额可能翻倍，达到三分之一。这将使**欧洲**的大型国家冠军如大众汽车和斯泰兰蒂斯（其最大股东Exor部分拥有《经济学人》的母公司）失去主导地位。从风力发电机到铁路设备，**欧洲**的制造商正忐忑地向东看。

China’s focus is on green goods, most significantly electric vehicles, for which its global market share could double, to a third, by 2030. That would end the dominance of Europe’s national champions like Volkswagen and Stellantis (whose largest shareholder, Exor, part-owns *The Economist*’s parent company). From wind turbines to railway equipment, Europe’s manufacturers are nervously looking eastward.

在11月之后，制造商可能也会向西看。特朗普上次执政时对钢铁和铝进口征收关税，最终还包括来自欧洲的进口，导致**欧盟**对摩托车和威士忌展开报复，直到2021年拜登总统下达不安的休战。如今，特朗普威胁对所有进口征收10%的全面关税；他的顾问们谈到进一步采取行动。

After November manufacturers might look westward, too. Last time he was in office Mr Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, eventually including those from Europe, leading the EU to retaliate against motorbikes and whiskey until an uneasy truce was struck under President Joe Biden in 2021. Today Mr Trump threatens a 10% blanket tariff on all imports; his advisers talk of going further.

贸易战的另一轮威胁着**欧洲**的出口商，在2023年他们在美国的销售额达到了5000亿欧元（5400亿美元）。特朗普着迷于双边贸易差额，意味着**欧盟**27个成员国中有20个商品贸易顺差的国家是自然的目标。他的团队还对**欧洲**的数字税、碳边境税和增值税感到不满。

Another round of the trade war threatens Europe’s exporters, which had €500bn ($540bn) of sales in America in 2023. Mr Trump is obsessed with bilateral trade balances, meaning that the 20 (of 27) EU member states with a goods-trade surplus are natural targets. His team is also aggrieved by Europe’s digital levies, its carbon border tax and its value-added taxes.

**欧洲**应该怎么办呢？前方的道路上布满了陷阱。一个错误是在脆弱时刻维持经济政策过于紧缩——这是**欧洲央行**以前犯过的错误。近年来，该行正确地通过提高利率来对抗通胀。但与挥霍无度的美国相比，**欧洲**的各国政府正在调整预算，这应该有助于降温经济，而廉价的中国商品将直接降低通胀。这使得**欧洲**央行有空间降低利率以支持增长。如果央行保持经济不陷入停滞从而使受到冲击的工人找到新工作，应对外部干扰将更加容易。

What should Europe do? The path ahead is littered with traps. One error would be to keep economic policy too tight at a moment of vulnerability—a mistake the European Central Bank has made before. In recent years the bank has rightly fought inflation with interest-rate increases. But in contrast to free-spending America, Europe’s governments are bringing their budgets into better balance, which should cool the economy, while cheap Chinese goods will bring down inflation directly. That gives Europe’s central banks room to cut interest rates to support growth. It will be easier to cope with disruption from outside if central banks keep the economy out of a slump that would stop displaced workers finding new jobs.

另一个陷阱是效仿美国和中国的保护主义，向受益行业投放大量补贴。补贴战是零和游戏，浪费稀缺资源——在**欧洲**内部，各国已经开始了一场国际大赛。中国最近的经济困境展示了过度政府计划的缺陷，而美国的产业政策并没有像拜登总统希望的那样吸引选民，关税造成的失业比创造的工作还要多。

Another trap would be to copy America’s and China’s protectionism by unleashing vast subsidies on favoured industries. Subsidy wars are zero-sum and squander scarce resources—within Europe, countries have already started an intra-continental race to the bottom. China’s recent economic woes demonstrate the flaws, not the virtues, of excessive government planning; America’s industrial policy has not wowed voters in the way President Biden had hoped, and tariffs have cost more jobs than they have produced.

相比之下，贸易即使在贸易伙伴保护主义时也能使经济更加繁荣。美国制造业的繁荣是**欧洲**生产商提供零部件的机会；来自中国的廉价进口将使绿色能源转型更加顺利，并为在能源危机中蒙受困扰的消费者提供救援。在试图阻止美国和中国进一步扰乱全球贸易秩序方面，有理由对保护主义采取选择性和适度的报复。但这将对**欧洲**经济造成损失，同时伤害其意图的目标。

By contrast, trade makes economies richer even when their trading partners are protectionist. A manufacturing boom in America is a chance for European producers to supply parts; cheap imports from China will make the green-energy transition easier and provide relief to consumers who suffered during the energy crisis. Selective and proportional retaliation against protectionism may be justified in an attempt to dissuade America and China from further disrupting global trade flows. But it would come at a cost to Europe’s economy, as well as hurting its intended targets.

相反，**欧洲**应该构建适合当下的经济政策。随着美国向工业投入大量公共资金，**欧洲**应该加大对基础设施、教育和研发的投入。与中国干预主义不同，**欧洲**应该意识到中国企业从庞大的国内市场中获得的好处。整合**欧洲**服务市场，其中贸易仍然困难，将有助于企业增长，奖励创新，并替代部分失去的制造业岗位。**欧盟**应该改革其繁琐和分散的监管，这也阻碍了服务业的发展。统一资本市场，包括伦敦的资本市场，将产生同样的效果。**欧洲**外交人员应该在任何尚未被拒绝的贸易协议上签署，而不是像在最近几次谈判中让农民阻挡。联接电网将使经济更加能够抵御能源冲击，并平稳过渡到绿色能源。

Instead Europe should forge its own economic policy fit for the moment. As America showers industry with public money, Europe should spend on infrastructure, education, and research and development. Instead of emulating China’s interventionism, Europe should note the benefit Chinese firms derive from a vast domestic market. Integrating Europe’s market for services, where trade remains difficult, would help firms grow, reward innovation and replace some lost manufacturing jobs. The eu should reform its burdensome and fragmented regulation, which also holds back service industries. Unifying capital markets—including those in London—would have the same effect. European diplomats should sign trade deals wherever they are still on offer, rather than letting farmers hold them up, as in several recent negotiations. Linking electricity grids would make the economy more resilient to energy shocks and smooth the green transition.

在保护主义时代，这样一个开放议程可能看起来很天真。但正是深沉、开放的市场具有潜力在世界变化之际推动**欧洲**的增长。当冲击来临时，决策者必须保持对这一现实的清醒认识。■

Such an open agenda in a protectionist age may seem naive. But it is deep, open markets that have the potential to boost Europe’s growth as the world changes around it. As the shocks strike, policymakers must stay grounded in that reality. ■



<hr><span style="color: red;"><b>领导者 | 乌克兰战争</b></span> (Leaders | War in Ukraine)

俄罗斯正准备在长达数百公里的前线展开新一轮大规模进攻 (Russia is gearing up for a big new push along a long front line)
=========================================================================================

乌克兰必须做好准备 (Ukraine must prepare)
-----------------------------

![乌克兰士兵参加顿涅茨克州的军事训练演习](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_LDP001.jpg)

乌克兰春天的到来带来了两种暂时的喘息。更温暖的天气意味着俄罗斯对电力和天然气基础设施的疯狂导弹和无人机袭击不会再那么难以忍受。随着新的温暖，泥泞来临，军事行动变得困难的大约一个月的时间将到来。这应该会阻碍俄罗斯沿着横跨乌克兰东部和南部的前线发动攻势的浪潮。但这种情况不会持续太久。随着春天过渡到夏天，有人担心俄罗斯会像去年那样发动一场大规模的新攻势。而乌克兰现在能够抵挡这一攻势的能力看起来比过去要不那么确定。这就是为什么它迫切需要动员更多的部队，并建设更加坚固的前线防御地。

THE ARRIVAL of spring in Ukraine brings two kinds of respite. Warmer weather means that Russia’s frenzied missile and drone attacks on electrical and gas infrastructure will not be quite so unbearable. And with new warmth comes mud, and a month or so in which military movement grows difficult. That should hinder the wave of Russian attacks along the front line that stretches across eastern and southern Ukraine. But it will not last. As spring turns to summer, the fear is that Russia will mount a big new offensive, as it did last year. And Ukraine’s ability to hold it off this time looks much less sure now than it did then. That is why it urgently needs to mobilise more troops and build more robust front-line defences.

可以理解乌克兰人把自己的困境归咎于世界政治家。忙于中东事务、即将到来的选举和自身经济困境，乌克兰的**西方盟友**分散了注意力。正如我们报道的那样，国会中支持特朗普的共和党人阻止了拜登政府提供的610亿美元军事援助包对乌克兰的影响已经显现在前线和乌克兰城市上空。乌克兰士兵被迫限制弹药使用，而俄罗斯在某些地方以五比一的优势压倒他们。就在上周的一个晚上，超过150架无人机和导弹袭击了乌克兰，但乌克兰的拦截器已经不足——尤其是那些可以摧毁最致命入侵者的拦截器。

Ukrainians understandably blame the world’s politicians for their plight. Busy with the Middle East, forthcoming elections and their own economic woes, Ukraine’s [Western allies](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/21/ukraines-european-allies-are-either-broke-small-or-irresolute) are distracted. As we [report](https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/25/ukraine-is-in-a-race-against-time-to-fortify-its-front-line), the decision by Trump-supporting Republicans in Congress to block the Biden administration’s $61bn military package for Ukraine is having an effect at the front line and above Ukraine’s cities. Ukraine’s soldiers are being forced to ration their shells, while Russia outguns them in some places by five to one. More than 150 drones and missiles were launched against Ukraine on just one night last week, but Ukraine is running out of interceptors—especially the ones that can take out the deadliest intruders.

*阅读更多有关[乌克兰战争](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis)的报道*

*Read more of our recent coverage of the [Ukraine war](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis)*

美国的僵局可能让俄罗斯攻破乌克兰不足的防线。然而，尽管法国总统马克龙表达了战斗口号，坚持认为俄罗斯必须被打败，但实际上却未提供多少实质帮助；德国总理奥拉夫·肖尔茨也无济于事，拒绝提供强大的Taurus远程导弹。欧洲未能实现本月向乌克兰提供100万枚炮弹的目标，尽管捷克一直在全球搜寻以弥补供应不足。资金也是一个问题；欧洲也应该提供帮助。但波兰和法国等国正试图阻止乌克兰的主要农产品出口，以保护自己的农民。

America’s deadlock risks letting Russia break through Ukraine’s inadequate defensive lines. And the Europeans are not doing much better, despite fighting talk from France’s president, Emmanuel Macron—who insists that Russia must be defeated but sends little in the way of hardware to help that happen—or Germany’s lacklustre chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who is refusing to supply powerful Taurus long-range missiles. Europe has failed to meet its target of getting 1m shells to Ukraine by this month, though the Czechs have been scouring the world to make up the shortfall. Money is also a problem; Europe should be helping with that, too. But Poland and France, among others, are trying to block Ukraine’s vital agricultural exports so as to protect their own farmers.

然而，乌克兰不能仅仅归咎于其盟友。它自己也犯了错误。其中之一是在人手方面出现了失误。俄罗斯正在筹备下一波动员浪潮，准备发动下一次大规模攻势。3月22日莫斯科音乐会厅发生的恐怖袭击实际上可能使弗拉基米尔·普京更容易做出这种决定，他正利用这一事件声称俄罗斯需要在血腥敌人面前变得强大。但在乌克兰方面，提高新兵数量的尝试仍然陷入了民主程序的泥沼；据报告，议会已经提出了1000多项修正案，这些修正案将使政府在提升军队实力方面有更大的空间。由于缺乏资金且担心不受欢迎，乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基没有竭尽全力实现自己的意愿。

Yet Ukraine cannot simply blame its allies. It is guilty of mistakes too. One has been its failure on manpower. Russia is gearing up for another wave of mobilisation, with an eye to its next big push. The terrorist attack on a Moscow concert hall on March 22nd may actually make this easier for Vladimir Putin, who is using it to claim that Russia needs to be strong in the face of bloodthirsty enemies. But in Ukraine attempts to raise fresh recruits are still stuck in the coils of the democratic process; more than 1,000 amendments have reportedly been tabled to a bill in Parliament that would give the government more scope to raise the army it needs. Short of cash and fearing unpopularity, President Volodymyr Zelensky has not tried hard enough to get his way.

乌克兰也非常晚才加强自身的防御阵地。在某种程度上，这是可以理解的。政府仍然梦想发动一次新的反攻，并担心目前的前线可能会硬化为类似边境的东西，将国家五分之一的领土切割出去，并剥夺其大部分海上通道。当前前线可能会成为未来和平谈判的基础这种想法，正是泽连斯基先生一直想要避免的。但是当前的风险是如此之大，以至于这是最不糟糕的选择。最近几周，挖掘机已经开始转移，障碍物已经开始布设。本该早些时候开始的。希望现在不算太迟。 ■

Ukraine has also been very late in reinforcing its own defensive positions. In a way, this is understandable. The government still dreams of a new counter-offensive, and dreads the idea that the current front line may harden into something very like a border, one that lops off a fifth of the country and deprives it of most of its sea access. The idea that this line might become the basis for a future peace negotiation is exactly what Mr Zelensky has wanted to avoid. But the dangers are now so great that it is the least bad option. In recent weeks the diggers have started moving, and the dragon’s teeth are being sown. It should have started much earlier. Pray that it is not too late. ■

来自南极洲的迫在眉睫的威胁 (The looming threat from Antarctica)
===============================================

大规模融冰将给世界其他地区带来意想不到的后果。 (A big thaw will have unexpected consequences for the rest of the world)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![南奥克尼群岛外的海域漂浮着冰山](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_LDP501.jpg)

北极和南极，合乎情理地是截然相反的。前者是被大陆包围的海洋，而后者则是被海洋环绕的大陆。在北极，有土著人民和移民社区；而在南极，只有一季或两季停留的短暂居民。自冷战以来，拥有核武器的大国在北极对峙；同样的冲突使得南极成为了一个以和平科学合作为基础的治理体系，其构想之乌托邦超越了外交史上任何其他协议。北极有北极熊的雄伟壮观，南极有企鹅的哀愁悲情。这两者面临着由全球变暖引起的深刻动荡。但与影响北极的变化相比，南极所面临的威胁被严重低估。

The Arctic and Antarctic are, fittingly, polar opposites. The first is an ocean surrounded by continents, the second a continent surrounded by an ocean. In the one, communities of indigenous people and settlers; in the other, only transients, there for a season or two. Nuclear-armed powers have faced off across the Arctic since the cold war; the same conflict saw a governance regime of peaceful scientific collaboration created for Antarctica that is more utopian in its conception than any other agreement in the annals of diplomacy. The north has the majesty of polar bears, the south the pathos of penguins. The two are united in facing profound upheaval because of global warming. But compared with the changes affecting the Arctic, those threatening the Antarctic are greatly underappreciated.

部分原因在于人们对南极的疏远；那里最大的基地是美国的麦克默多，离最近的城市（新西兰的基督城）近4000公里。很大程度上，访问南极的人主要是科学家、探险家和支援人员。另一方面，南极似乎保持着静止。南极的变化不像阿拉斯加那样，那里的永久冻土融化导致道路起伏不平、建筑物倒塌；或者西伯利亚，那里燃烧的苔原地带烟雾弥漫天空，灼伤肺腑。事实上，很长一段时间以来，科学家们倾向于认为南极相对稳定，至少在短中期内是如此。是的，南极的冰盖蕴含足以使海平面上升60米的水，但任何崩溃都需要几个世纪的时间。

In part that lack of attention is because of Antarctica’s remoteness; the biggest base there, America’s McMurdo, is almost 4,000km from the nearest city (Christchurch, in New Zealand). Visits are for the most part made only by scientists, adventurers and support staff. In part, too, there is seeming stasis. [Change in Antarctica](https://www.economist.com/interactive/science-and-technology/2024/03/27/antarctica-earths-largest-refrigerator-is-defrosting) is not like that in Alaska, where melting permafrost buckles roads and topples buildings; or in Siberia, where the smoke from burning tundra paints the skies and sears the lungs. Indeed, for a long time scientists tended to see Antarctica as relatively stable, at least over the short to medium term. Yes, its ice sheets contain enough water to raise the seas by 60 metres—but any collapse would take centuries.

结果证明这种态度是自满的。正如我们在本周的科学技术版块所描述的那样，地球上最大的冰箱正在出现令人担忧的大规模融化迹象，这将对地球其他地区产生后果。像去年南半球冬天时期海冰面积消失相当于格陵兰岛大小的极端事件，是潜在不稳定加剧的一个症状。冰川学家正在谈论“制度性转变”。覆盖南极98%的庞大冰盖的部分正在向海洋滑去。

That turns out to have been complacent. Earth’s largest refrigerator is, as we describe in this week’s Science and technology pages, showing alarming signs of a big thaw, one which will have consequences for the rest of the planet. Extreme events like the disappearance of an area of sea ice the size of Greenland during last year’s austral winter are a symptom of a quickening underlying instability. Glaciologists are talking of a “regime shift”. Parts of one of the enormous ice sheets that cover 98% of the continent are sliding towards the seas.

20年前，来自南极大陆基岩进入南大洋的水只占全球海平面上升的4%。如今，其占比为12%，并且未来几十年将不断上升。这一影响有一个被低估的必然结果。随着南极融化，其缩小的冰对周边海洋的引力减弱。这导致其他地区的海平面上升速度更快。源自南极的海平面上升将影响澳大利亚和大洋洲，但同时也会对北美造成更为严重的影响。

Water shifting from Antarctica’s continental bedrock into the Southern Ocean contributed just 4% to global sea-level rise 20 years ago. Today its share is 12%, and it will rise relentlessly in the decades ahead. This effect has an underappreciated corollary. As Antarctica melts, the gravitational attraction its shrinking ice exerts on the neighbouring seas weakens. That causes sea levels elsewhere to rise even faster. Sea-level rise originating from Antarctica will affect Australia and Oceania, but it will also disproportionately affect North America.

融化的冰盖不仅会提升海平面。它们还会带来大气环流的变化，延伸至赤道及之外，改变萨赫勒和亚马孙地区的天气。南大洋是全球最大的碳汇之一，负责吸收全球每年所有吸取的有气候影响的二氧化碳的40%。如果南大洋变暖，其吸收作用将减弱——这种影响可能在数万亿吨淡水脱离南极大规模冻土后加剧。

Melting ice sheets do more than raise sea levels. They also bring shifts in atmospheric circulation that stretch to the equator and beyond, changing weather in the Sahel and Amazonia. And the Southern Ocean is one of the world’s largest carbon sinks, responsible for absorbing 40% of all the climate-changing carbon dioxide that the oceans as a whole suck up every year. If it warms, it will absorb less—an effect that may be aggravated when trillions of tonnes of fresh water come off the great frozen South and alter ocean currents.

尽管如此，一些国家正在削减对南极研究的预算。这是违背常理的。冰盖的测量和模拟远远落后于大气和海洋洋流的研究；如果要正确理解和规划恶化局势的含义，就需要迅速解决这个问题。

Despite all this, some countries are cutting their budgets for Antarctic research. This flies in the face of reason. The measurement and modelling of ice sheets lags well behind the study of the atmosphere and of ocean currents; if the implications of the worsening situation are to be properly appreciated and planned for, this needs fixing fast.

关于最紧急需要做的事情，以及如何最好地合作完成这些任务的争论，应该激励身为南极条约签署国的56个国家。他们可能无法保护南极环境，这是南极条约环境议定书要求他们履行的责任。但至少可以加大努力，了解这个被寄予其国的空旷大陆所发生的变化对世界其他地区意味着什么。■

Debates over what needs doing most urgently, and how best to co-operate to get it done, should be galvanising the 56 countries that are signatories to the Antarctic treaty. They may not be able to protect the Antarctic environment, a duty to which the treaty’s environmental protocol commits them. They can at least increase their efforts to learn what the changes being forced on the empty continent in their charge mean for the rest of the world.■

AI医生将会在……最终看到您 (The AI doctor will see you…eventually)
===================================================

人工智能在医疗保健领域有着巨大的潜力。但它也面临巨大的障碍。 (Artificial intelligence holds huge promise in health care. But it also faces massive barriers)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![一名医生，头部显示加载图标的计算机屏幕](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_LDD002_FH.jpg)

更好的诊断。为患者提供个性化支持。更快的药物发现。更高的效率。**人工智能**（AI）正在各处引发激动和夸大之词，但在医疗保健领域，它有改变性的潜力。 在欧洲，分析师们预测利用AI可以每年挽救数十万人的生命；据称在美国，它也可以节省资金，每年从总计4.5万亿美元的医疗支出中削减2000亿至3600亿美元（占年度GDP的17%）。 从智能听诊器和机器人外科医生到分析大数据集或与具有人脸的医疗AI交谈的能力，机会无处不在。

Better diagnoses. Personalised support for patients. Faster drug discovery. Greater efficiency. [Artificial intelligence](https://www.economist.com/topics/artificial-intelligence) (AI) is generating excitement and hyperbole everywhere, but in the field of health care it has the potential to be transformational. In Europe analysts predict that deploying AI could save hundreds of thousands of lives each year; in America, they say, it could also save money, shaving $200bn-360bn from overall annual medical spending, now $4.5trn a year (or 17% of GDP). From smart stethoscopes and robot surgeons to the analysis of large data sets or the ability to chat to a medical AI with a human face, opportunities abound.

已经有证据表明，AI系统可以提高诊断的准确性和疾病追踪，改善患者结果的预测并提供更好的治疗方案。 它还可以通过承担诸如医学转录和监测患者等任务以及简化管理而提高医院和手术室的效率。 它可能已经加速了新药物进入临床试验的时间。新工具，包括生成AI，可以为这些能力提供强力支持。  然而，正如本周我们的[科技季度文章](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2024-03-30)所展示的，尽管AI在医疗保健领域已经使用多年，但整合进展缓慢，结果常常平庸。

There is already evidence that AI systems can enhance diagnostic accuracy and disease tracking, improve the prediction of patients’ outcomes and suggest better treatments. It can also boost efficiency in hospitals and surgeries by taking on tasks such as medical transcription and monitoring patients, and by streamlining administration. It may already be speeding the time it takes for new drugs to reach clinical trials. New tools, including generative AI, could supercharge these abilities. Yet as our [Technology Quarterly](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2024-03-30) this week shows, although AI has been used in health care for many years, integration has been slow and the results have often been mediocre.

这其中有好的原因，也有不好的原因。 好的原因是，当引入新工具时，医疗保健需要高的证据标准，以保护患者的安全。 不好的原因涉及数据、监管和激励。 克服这些困难可能会为其他领域的AI提供经验教训。

There are good and bad reasons for this. The good reasons are that health care demands high evidentiary barriers when introducing new tools, to protect patients’ safety. The bad reasons involve data, regulation and incentives. Overcoming them could hold lessons for AI in other fields.

AI系统通过处理大量数据来学习，而医疗保健提供者拥有大量这样的数据。 但医疗数据高度分散；严格的规定控制其使用。 政府意识到患者希望他们的医疗隐私受到保护。 但患者也希望获得更好和更个性化的护理。 每年大约有80万美国人因为糟糕的医疗决策而受害。

AI systems learn by processing huge volumes of data, something health-care providers have in abundance. But health data is highly fragmented; strict rules control its use. Governments recognise that patients want their medical privacy protected. But patients also want better and more personalised care. Each year roughly 800,000 Americans suffer from poor medical decision-making.

提高AI工具的准确性和减少偏见需要在充分反映患者多样性的大数据集上对其进行训练。 找到安全的方法让医疗数据更自由地流动将有所帮助。 但这也可能使患者受益：他们应该被赋予访问以便随身携带的个人记录的权利，数字化格式。 消费者健康公司已经开始利用可穿戴设备的数据，但效果参差不齐。 可移植的患者记录将使人们更充分地利用他们的数据，并更多地为自己的健康负责。

Improving accuracy and reducing bias in AI tools requires them to be trained on large data sets that reflect patients’ full diversity. Finding secure ways to allow health data to move more freely would help. But it could benefit patients, too: they should be given the right to access their own records in a portable, digital format. Consumer-health firms are already making use of data from wearables, with varying success. Portable patients’ records would let people make fuller use of their data and take more responsibility for their health.

另一个问题是管理和监管这些创新。 在许多国家，包括在其他领域一样，AI在医疗领域的治理与创新的迅速步伐难以保持同步。监管机构可能会缓慢批准新的AI工具，或者可能缺乏能力和专业知识。 政府需要使监管机构有能力评估新的AI工具。 他们还需要填补对不良事件监测以及对算法的持续监控的监管漏洞，以确保其保持准确、安全、有效和透明。

Another problem is managing and regulating these innovations. In many countries the governance of AI in health, as in other areas, is struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation. Regulatory authorities may be slow to approve new AI tools or may lack capacity and expertise. Governments need to equip regulators to assess new AI tools. They also need to fill regulatory gaps in the surveillance of adverse events, and in the continuous monitoring of algorithms to ensure they remain accurate, safe, effective and transparent.

这将是困难的。 一个解决方案是各国合作，互相学习，制定最低的全球标准。 更简单的国际监管体系也将有助于创造一个让小公司能创新的市场。 较少发达的健康基础设施较少的较贫穷国家有许多可以从引入新工具中获益，例如用于产科的AI驱动可携式超声设备。 因为AI工具的替代方案通常是根本不治疗，它们甚至可能会越过富裕国家根深蒂固的卫生系统——尽管数据、连接性和计算能力的缺乏会构成阻碍。

That will be hard. One solution would be for countries to work together, to learn from each other and create minimum global standards. A less complex international regulatory system would also help create a market in which small companies can innovate. Poorer countries, with less developed health infrastructure, have much to gain from introducing new tools, such as an AI-powered portable ultrasound device for obstetrics. Because the alternative to an AI tool is often no treatment at all, they may even be able to leapfrog the entrenched health systems of rich countries—though a lack of data, connectivity and computing power will get in the way.

最后一个问题涉及机构和激励措施。 AI承诺通过协助或更换工作人员、提高生产率、减少错误、缩减或削减支出，同时改善护理来降低医疗成本。 这是迫切需要的。 到2030年，全球可能缺少1000万医护人员，约占当今的劳动力的15%。 在2022年，管理占美国多余医疗成本的大约30%，与其他国家相比。

A final problem involves institutions and incentives. AI promises to cut medical costs by assisting or replacing workers, improving productivity, reducing errors and flattening or reducing spending, all while improving care. That is desperately needed. The world could lack 10m health-care workers by 2030, around 15% of today’s workforce. And administration accounted for about 30% of America’s excess health-care costs, compared with other countries, in 2022.

然而，利用创新节省金钱是棘手的。 医疗体系被建立起来是用来提高护理，而不是削减成本的。 新技术可能占据医疗支出的年度增长高达一半。 叠加新系统将增加成本和复杂性。 但重新设计流程以有效利用AI很可能会受到患者和医务人员的阻力。 虽然AI可能可以通过电话为他们分诊或提供常规结果，患者可能会要求亲自就诊。

Yet saving money using innovation is tricky. Health systems are set up to use it to improve care, not cut costs. New technology may account for as much as half of the annual growth in health spending. Layering on new systems will increase costs and complexity. But redesigning processes to make efficient use of AI is likely to be resisted by patients and medics. Though AI may be able to triage them over the phone or provide routine results, patients may demand to be seen in person.

更糟糕的是，许多医疗体系，如美国的，被建立起来奖励工作量。 他们没有理由采用可以减少就诊次数、检测或程序的技术。 甚至公立医疗体系可能缺乏激励采用可以降低成本而非提高结果的技术，也许因为节约资金可能导致明年预算缩减。 除非政府能够改变这些激励措施，使AI结合更好的治疗与新的效率，否则创新将增加成本。 因此，政府和卫生当局需要资助专门测试和部署新的AI技术的计划。 包括美国、英国和加拿大在内的国家正在指明方向。

Worse, many health systems, such as America’s, are set up to reward the volume of work. They have little reason to adopt technologies that cut the number of visits, tests or procedures. And even publicly run health-care systems may lack incentives to adopt technologies that reduce costs rather than improve outcomes, perhaps because saving money may lead to a smaller budget next year. Unless governments can change these incentives, so that AI combines better treatment with new efficiencies, innovation will increase costs. Accordingly, governments and health authorities will need to fund schemes dedicated to testing and deploying new AI technologies. Countries including America, Britain and Canada are pointing the way.

提升医疗保健领域中AI的责任在很大程度上落在政府和监管机构身上。 然而，公司也有一定的作用可以发挥。 保险公司已经使用AI工具不公平地拒绝支付医疗保障；公司已经对健康AI的功能进行误导性销售或夸大宣传；算法出现过失误。 各公司有责任确保其产品安全、可靠且应对承担责任，人类，尽管存在缺陷，仍处于控制之中。

Much of the burden for boosting AI in health care falls on governments and regulators. However, companies have a part to play, too. Insurers have already used AI tools to deny care unfairly; firms have mis-sold or overstated the abilities of health AI; algorithms have made mistakes. Firms have a duty to ensure that their products are safe, reliable and accountable, and that humans, however flawed, remain in control.

这些障碍是巨大的，但在医疗保健领域使用AI的潜在好处是巨大的，因此克服这些障碍的必要性应该是显而易见的。 如果AI在医学中可以发挥作用，它可能会为其他领域中的技术采用提供一剂良方。 ■

These obstacles are formidable but the potential benefits of using AI in health care are so vast that the case for overcoming them should be obvious. And if AI can be made to work in medicine, it could provide a prescription for the adoption of the technology in other fields. ■

一起可怕谋杀案引发了中国有关少年司法的辩论 (A gruesome murder sparks a debate about juvenile justice in China)
======================================================================================

一个原本更加仁慈的体系正在受到考验。 (A system that had become more merciful is being tested)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

![中国贵州的一个儿童](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_CNP002.jpg)

在孔子被认为是他的著名评论中，他说在15岁时，他下定决心要学习。在30、40、50和60岁时，他逐渐达到了新的成熟和理解层次。但直到70岁时，他才学会如何追随内心的欲望而不越界。如今，距离这位伟大的圣人讲学已经2500年了，中国社会继续探讨有关对青少年违法者在宽容和责任之间找到恰当平衡的伦理问题。

IN ONE OF the best-known commentaries attributed to him, Confucius said that at the age of 15 he set his mind on studying. At the ages of 30, 40, 50 and 60 he reached successive new levels of maturity and understanding. But it was only at the age of 70 that he had learnt how to follow his heart’s desires without overstepping boundaries. Today, 2,500 years since the great sage held forth, Chinese society continues to grapple with ethical questions about the appropriate balance between leniency and accountability for juvenile transgressors of the law.

一起可怕的谋杀案引发了新一轮关于如何对待年轻罪犯的辩论。这起案件涉及中国北方城市邯郸市郊的三名初中学生。据称，他们虐待一个同学已经很长一段时间。然后，在3月10日，他们杀害了他。死者的尸体被埋在一处废弃的温室中。一些中国媒体报道称，嫌疑人在谋杀前一天就开始挖坟，表明这是预谋的罪行。据说涉案的凶手都被羁押了。和受害者一样，他们都不满14岁。

A horrific murder has spurred a new round of debate about how to treat young criminals. The case involves three middle-school students in the rural outskirts of Handan, a city in northern China. They are alleged to have bullied a classmate over a long period of time. Then, on March 10th, they killed him. His body was buried in an abandoned greenhouse. Some Chinese media outlets are reporting that the suspects began digging the grave a day before the murder, indicating that the crime was premeditated. The alleged killers are all said to be in custody. Like the victim, they are all under the age of 14.

这一点很重要，因为中国在2021年修改了刑法，将能够起诉谋杀嫌疑人的年龄从14岁降低到12岁。邯郸案似乎是第一起适用新年龄标准的案件。

That is significant because China amended its criminal code in 2021, lowering the age at which murder suspects can be prosecuted from 14 to 12. The Handan case appears to be the first in which the new age standards will apply.

中国司法系统总体上并没有以宽容、公平和独立而闻名。警察、检察官和法官都受共产党控制。刑事案件中的无罪判决极为罕见。但观察家称，在青少年司法领域，中国的做法更为宽容。14至18岁的被定罪人数从2013年的55,817人下降到2022年的27,757人。美国权利活动家约翰·卡姆表示，官员也日益倾向于封存未成年人的刑事记录，以免在成年后困扰他们。他所在的位于旧金山的对话基金会与中国官员合作，改善对年轻被拘留者的处理。

The Chinese justice system does not, in general, have a reputation for leniency—or fairness and independence, for that matter. Police, prosecutors and judges are all controlled by the Communist Party. Acquittals in criminal cases are exceedingly rare. But in the field of juvenile justice, China has been moving in a more merciful direction, say observers. The number of convictions of those aged 14 to 18 fell from 55,817 in 2013 to 27,757 in 2022. Officials are also increasingly open to the idea of sealing the criminal records of juveniles so that they don’t haunt them in adulthood, says John Kamm, an American rights activist. His Dui Hua Foundation, based in San Francisco, has worked with Chinese officials to improve the treatment of young detainees.

然而，并不是每个人都对这些变化感到满意。卡姆先生说：“在中国，无论罪犯年龄大小，你肯定会遇到一种‘罪有应得’的态度。”对于邯郸的谋杀案，一位专家告诉当地报纸《重庆日报》，这起血腥事件需要严厉回应，以遏制“小妖精”。著名法学家罗翔在线上发表声明称，对该案的适当处理“只能通过惩罚来实现”。

Not everyone is happy with these changes, though. “In China you certainly encounter a ‘do the crime, do the time’ sort of attitude, regardless of an offender’s age,” says Mr Kamm. Such opinions have been expressed in response to the murder in Handan. One expert told *Chongqing Daily*, a local newspaper, that the bloody episode demanded a harsh response in order to deter “little demons”. Luo Xiang, a well-known legal scholar, posted a statement online saying the appropriate handling of the case “could only be achieved through punishment”.

在今年早些时候发生的另一起令人发指的案件中，据报道湖北省一名不满12岁的男孩谋杀了一个四岁女孩。由于年龄原因，该男孩无法被起诉，而是被转介接受精神治疗。但一些人在社交媒体上表达了愤慨。一名评论者表示，基于年龄的刑事起诉禁令只会助长霸凌行为，而加害者“不应被允许长大”。

In another grisly case from earlier this year a four-year-old girl was reportedly murdered by a boy under the age of 12 in the central province of Hubei. Because of his age, the boy could not be prosecuted and was instead referred for psychiatric treatment. But some expressed outrage on social media. One commenter said age-based prohibitions on criminal prosecutions only serve to embolden bullies and that the perpetrator “should not be allowed to grow up”.

邯郸案中引起更多同情的一个方面是“留守儿童”的困境，即那些父母离开村庄到城市打工的孩子。根据2020年最新人口普查，中国有6700万这样的儿童（总人口14亿）。许多孩子住在远离家乡的农村寄宿学校，这是政府试图提高农村教育水平的结果。这些男孩和女孩患抑郁症、药物滥用和行为问题的比率比同龄人高。

There is one facet of the Handan case that has elicited more sympathy. That is the plight of “left-behind children”, or those whose parents have left their villages to look for work in cities. According to the most recent census, in 2020, there are 67m such children in China (out of a total population of 1.4bn). Many live in rural boarding schools far from their homes, a result of the government’s attempt to improve educational standards in the countryside. These boys and girls have higher rates of depression, substance abuse and bad behaviour than their peers.

据报道，邯郸的受害者和凶手都是留守儿童。这导致人们呼吁在学校和社区提供更好的支持。孔子曾强调良好家庭与善治国家之间的联系，他肯定会同意这一点。■

According to reports, the victim and the perpetrators in Handan were left-behind children. That has led to calls for better support in schools and communities. Confucius, who made much of the connection between well-managed families and well-governed states, would surely agree. ■

如何看待中国庞大的网络间谍活动 (What to make of China’s massive cyber-espionage campaign)
=======================================================================

美国和其他国家提供了关于中国间谍活动的丰富细节 (America and others offer rich details of what Chinese spies are up to)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![英国副首相奥利弗·道登（Oliver Dowden）](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_CNP003.jpg)

当西方政府对中国提出指责时，它们有时倾向于团结一致。3月25日和26日，美国、英国和新西兰共同对中国的网络间谍行为进行了协调抨击。美国联邦检察官指控中国网络间谍对包括中国共产党批评者在内的西方各类目标进行了多年的攻击。英国副首相奥利弗·道登表示，中国展示了“针对我们共同民主体制的持续敌对活动模式”。新西兰则谴责中国的国家支持黑客对该国议会进行了网络攻击。

When calling out China, Western governments sometimes like to stand together. On March 25th and 26th America, Britain and New Zealand did so in a co-ordinated blast against Chinese cyber-espionage. American federal prosecutors accused China’s cyber-spooks of waging a campaign for years against a wide range of targets in the West, including critics of the Chinese Communist Party. Britain’s deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, said China showed “ongoing patterns of hostile activity targeting our collective democracies”. New Zealand blamed state-linked hackers in China for a cyber-attack on the country’s parliament.

美国和英国都对一组中国黑客的据说前线公司实施了制裁，他们将其称为**APT31**。他们还对这个团体中的两名涉嫌成员实施了制裁，同时美国对他们和其他五名男子提出了刑事指控。这些行动不太可能对中国的努力产生太大影响。字母**APT**代表“高级持续威胁”。这是指潜伏在目标网络中不被察觉的攻击的技术术语。这几个单词也恰好表达了西方对中国网络攻击的悲观看法。

Both America and Britain placed sanctions on an alleged front company for one group of Chinese hackers, which they called APT31. They also imposed sanctions on two of the group’s alleged members, while America laid criminal charges against them and five other men. These actions are unlikely to have much impact on China’s efforts. The letters APT stand for “advanced persistent threat”. This is technical jargon for an attack that involves lurking undetected in a target’s network. The words also happen to convey the West’s gloomy view of China’s cyber-onslaught.

发现网络入侵，更不用说确定责任者，都需要时间。三个西方国家披露的事件大多发生在两三年前。道登在议会上表示，“中国国家附属行动者”于2021年侵入了选举委员会的电子邮件和文件共享系统。此次入侵最早是于2023年8月公开宣布的，当时官员透露，直到2022年10月才发现了可疑活动——黑客入侵的时间已超过一年。肇事者可能已经获得了英国选民的地址。道登没有指明参与那次攻击的团体。但他说，**APT31**“几乎肯定”参与了旨在对议员电子邮件账户进行“侦察活动”的行动。受袭击的大多数人都是中国的著名批评者。

Spotting a cyber-intrusion, let alone identifying those responsible, can take time. The incidents revealed by the three Western countries mostly occurred two or three years ago. Mr Dowden told Parliament that “Chinese state-affiliated actors” had penetrated the Electoral Commission’s email and file-sharing systems in 2021. The breach was first publicly declared in August 2023, when officials revealed that suspicious activity had not been identified until October 2022—more than a year after the hackers had broken in. The perpetrators would have had access to the addresses of Britain’s voters. Mr Dowden did not specify the group involved in that attack. But he said APT31 was “almost certain” to have been behind “reconnaissance activity” aimed at MPs’ email accounts in 2021. Most of those targeted were prominent critics of China.

纽约法院对**APT31**的据称七名成员提出的起诉书详细描述了该团队的活动。这份长达27页的文件称，该团队在中国国家安全部湖北省分支下运作，该部门是中国的主要民用间谍机构。其前线公司武汉小睿致科技成立于2010年左右。从那时起，该公司据称一直瞄准美国及其他地区的数千名政客、学者、新闻记者和民主活动人士。根据文件，他们还瞄准了被视为“国家重要性”的美国行业的人物和公司，包括国防、IT和电信领域。

The indictment filed in a New York court against the alleged seven members of APT31 offered rich detail of this team’s activities. The 27-page document said the group operated under the Hubei provincial branch of China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS), the country’s main civilian spy agency. Its front company, Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science & Technology, was set up around 2010. Since then it has allegedly targeted thousands of politicians in America and elsewhere, as well as academics, journalists and pro-democracy activists. According to the document, it has also taken aim at people and companies in American industries deemed of “national importance”, including those relating to defence, IT and telecommunications.

英国淡化了它检测到的中国黑客攻击的影响——没有选举受到影响，而议员电子邮件的定位“已被议会的网络安全措施阻止”。新西兰表示，另一个与国安部门有关的团体，即**APT40**，曾于2021年参与了对其议会的网络攻击，但这并未导致敏感信息的泄露。然而，美国的起诉书称，**APT31**的活动“导致数百万美国人的工作和个人电子邮件账户、云存储账户和电话记录的实际和潜在泄密，其中至少有一些信息可能用于支持针对民主进程和机构的恶意影响”。

The British played down the impact of the Chinese hacking it had detected—no elections had been affected and the targeting of MPs’ emails had been “blocked by Parliament’s cyber-security measures”. New Zealand said another MSS-linked group, known as APT40, had been involved in the cyber-attack on its parliament in 2021, but this had not caused the leak of sensitive information. The American indictment, however, said APT31’s activities had “resulted in the confirmed and potential compromise of work and personal email accounts, cloud-storage accounts and telephone-call records belonging to millions of Americans, including at least some information that could be released in support of malign influence targeting democratic processes and institutions”.

网络安全公司Recorded Future的马克·凯利表示，公司了解到中国有大约50个黑客组织，其中包括为国安部或人民解放军工作的私人公司。肯定有更多黑客组织存在。凯利说，中国的网络间谍活动“在规模上远远超过”俄罗斯或朝鲜的。

Mark Kelly of Recorded Future, a cyber-security firm, says his company is aware of about 50 hacking groups in China, including private firms working for the MSS or People’s Liberation Army. There are undoubtedly many more. Mr Kelly describes China’s cyber-espionage efforts as “orders of magnitude” greater in scale than those mounted by Russia or North Korea.

正如起诉书所示，它们分工明确。英国前情报机构MI6副局长尼格尔·英克斯特表示，其中一些黑客组织专门从事对世界各个地区的间谍活动。他说，他们有相当大的自由度可以为所欲为：“我甚至不确定是否有任何形式的正式政治审批机制。”他们的许多工作都是外包给私人公司的。上个月，一家名为爱思恩（I-Soon）的公司的大规模在线文件泄露显示，该公司曾代表多个政府机构进行大规模网络监控。

As the indictment shows, they are surprisingly devolved. Some of them specialise in spying on different parts of the world, says Nigel Inkster, a former deputy head of Britain’s spy agency, MI6. They have considerable leeway to do as they wish, he says: “I’m not even sure that there is any kind of formal political clearance mechanism.” Much of their work is subcontracted to private firms. Last month a huge online dump of documents from one such company, I-Soon, showed its involvement in large-scale cyber-snooping on behalf of a variety of government agencies.

西方国家对于黑客窃取公司数据的担忧日益显现。今年1月，FBI局长克里斯托弗·雷表示，中国的政府支持黑客数量是其机构网络人员数量的“至少50倍”。他补充说，中国的黑客正在为可能的打击做准备，“在美国基础设施上部署，准备制造混乱，给美国公民和社区带来现实世界的伤害。”

The West’s anxieties, not least about the hackers’ theft of corporate data, are becoming increasingly manifest. In January the head of the FBI, Christopher Wray, said that China’s state-sponsored hackers outnumbered his agency’s cyber-personnel by “at least 50 to one”. He added that China’s hackers are laying the groundwork for a possible Chinese strike, “positioning on American infrastructure in preparation to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to American citizens and communities.”

中国外交官对此类指控予以否认。一名驻伦敦的中国大使馆发言人称英国的指控是“捏造和恶意中伤”。如果西方希望通过点名、指责和制裁来阻止中国间谍活动，他们可能会失望。正如英克斯特所言：“我认为北京不太关心被抓住红手指。” ■

Chinese diplomats have dismissed such accusations. A Chinese embassy spokesperson in London called Britain’s allegations “fabricated and malicious slanders”. If the West hopes that naming, shaming and sanctions will dissuade the Chinese spooks, it is likely to be disappointed. As Mr Inkster puts it: “I don’t think Beijing is particularly concerned about the political ramifications of getting caught with their fingers in the till any more.” ■



<hr><span style="color: red;"><b>中国 | 拥有习近平倾听的人</b></span> (China | The men with Xi’s ear)

中国经济团队中谁处于上位，谁被降职 (Who is up and who is down on China’s economic team)
===================================================================

习近平掌控全局。其他的需要分类。 (Xi Jinping is in charge. The rest need sorting)
--------------------------------------------------------------

![Illustration of Xi Jinping addressing a crowd, with Li Qiang on one side and He Feng in the background](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_CND001.jpg)

当习近平于3月27日在北京与美国商界高管会面时，对这些公司高管来说，这是一个难得的机会，可以在中国领导人的地盘上与其进行互动。此次会议是在京城一处宁静的国宾馆湖畔举行的年度中国发展论坛之后召开的，会议的经济背景并不平静，经济处于低迷状态，股市萎靡不振，监管力度时有加大。外国直接投资也大幅下滑（见下图）。

On March 27th, when Xi Jinping met American business executives in Beijing, it was a rare opportunity for these corporate bigwigs to interact with China’s leader on his home turf. The meeting followed the China Development Forum, an annual economic conference held amid the lakes and willows of a tranquil state guesthouse in the capital. The economic backdrop to the meeting was less serene, thanks to a faltering economy, depressed stockmarket and sporadic regulatory crackdowns. Foreign direct investment has slumped (see chart).

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_CNC083.png)

在过去，这样的会议并不由中国国家主席主持，而是由传统上主导经济政策的总理来负责。李强（见右侧图片）在去年论坛期间与包括苹果首席执行官蒂姆·库克在内的商人会面时，依然是新上任不久。希望在疫情之后恢复乐观情绪，李总理敦促访客们抬头看喻意义上的彩虹，而不是低头看脚下的泥泞。

In the past, such meetings were entrusted not to China’s president, but to its prime minister, who has traditionally held sway over economic policy. Li Qiang (pictured, right) was still new in the job when he met businessmen, including Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, on the sidelines of last year’s forum. Hoping to restore optimism after the pandemic, Mr Li urged his visitors to look up at the metaphorical rainbow after the rain, rather than down at the mud under their feet.

然而，今年，李总理的风头被他的上级抢走了。本月稍早时，中国全国人大会议结束时取消了总理的闭幕新闻发布会，他也错失了一个向外界传递信息的重要机会。

This year, however, Mr Li’s thunder has been stolen by his boss. The prime minister also missed a high-profile chance to communicate to the outside world earlier this month, when the annual meeting of China’s parliament dispensed with his closing press conference.

这种缄默正在逐渐成为一种模式。据香港《南华早报》报道，与前任相比，李总理在首年间与外国官员和商界领袖举行的会议更少，仅为前者的三分之二。他出访的次数也只有前任的一半。而且，他乘坐的是包机，而不是政府专机。

This reticence is becoming a pattern. Compared with his predecessor, Mr Li has held fewer meetings with foreign officials and business leaders in his first year: only two-thirds as many, according to the *South China Morning Post* in Hong Kong. He has travelled to only half as many meetings abroad. And when he has taken to the skies, he has flown on chartered flights rather than a government plane.

有关这些变化的原因在中国内部引发了一场争论。一种观点认为，李总理巧妙地向外界传递了对习近平的敬意，即使他在政策制定上仍具有相当大的影响力。另一种观点是，实际上他已经被降职。无论如何，总理的经济监管范围似乎变窄了，更侧重于国内新的增长引擎而非国际交往。如《南华早报》所指出的那样，李总理花费的时间比前任多在全国范围内进行考察。经济问题在领导层的优先事项中也失去了地位。无论他的影响力是否有所下降，李总理的影响范围都变小了。

There is a swirling debate inside China about what explains these changes. One view is that Mr Li is adroitly signalling his deference to Mr Xi, even as he retains substantial influence on policymaking. Another view is that he has been in effect demoted. Either way, the prime minister’s economic purview seems to have narrowed, focusing on new domestic growth engines not international exchanges. Mr Li has spent more time than his predecessor on inspection tours around the country, the *Post* points out. Economics has also lost ground to national security in the leadership’s priorities. Regardless of whether his influence has slipped, Mr Li holds sway over a diminished portfolio.

中国领导人的权力并不来自于其在政府中的职位，而是来自于其在共产党内部的地位，包括其24人的政治局常委会。到2027年党选举产生下一届常委会时，李总理将超过通常的68岁退休年龄。届时，他可能会在任一届总理后卸任。

The power of China’s leaders derives not from their position in the government, but from their standing in the Communist Party, including its 24-person Politburo. By the time the party picks its next Politburo in 2027, Mr Li will be above the customary retirement age of 68. He might then step down as prime minister after one term.

如果是这样的话，一个合理的接班人可能会是丁薛祥。丁先生是政治局常委会的七人常务委员会中最年轻的成员，他是2007年在上海与习近平关系密切的助手。然后，他跟随习近平到北京，并陪同他在第一任期内进行多次外访，包括访问唐纳德·特朗普在佛罗里达州的马阿拉歌度假村。

If so, a plausible successor would be Ding Xuexiang. The youngest member of the Politburo’s seven-man Standing Committee, Mr Ding was a close aide to Mr Xi in Shanghai in 2007. He then followed him to Beijing and accompanied him on many of his foreign trips during his first term as president, including a visit to Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

丁先生是中国国务院副总理中排名最高的，但他并没有在处理经济方面最具权力的党内委员会——中央全面深化改革委员会（以其对从养老金到足球等各方面的不够全面的改革而闻名）的职位。

Mr Ding is the highest-ranked of four deputy prime ministers on the State Council, China’s cabinet. But he does not hold a position on the most powerful party commission handling the economy: the sweeping Central Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission (known for its less-than-comprehensive reforms of everything from pensions to football).

在习近平的领导下，类似的党内委员会不断增加。与政府机构相比，这些组织的行动更不受限制，其成员也没有年龄限制。最著名的例子是中央财经领导小组（CFEAC）。其2021年的一次会议标志着习近平“共同繁荣”运动的开始（旨在惩戒亿万富翁，减少不平等现象）。习近平还在2月的一次会议上批准了中国版的“以旧换新”计划，为家庭和企业提供贸易旧电器和设备以获得新装备的激励措施。在经济政策制定方面，这些委员会挤占了国务院的影响力。自从去年修改规则以来，国务院的高官们只有每个月或每两个月才开会，而不是每周开会。

Similar party commissions have proliferated under Mr Xi. Compared with government bodies, these groups have fewer constraints on their action and no awkward age limits on their members. A prominent example is the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission (CFEAC). One of its meetings in 2021 signalled the start of Mr Xi’s “common prosperity” campaign (which aimed to chasten billionaires and reduce inequality). A meeting in February gave the nod to China’s version of a “cash for clunkers” scheme, which provides households and firms an incentive to trade in old appliances and equipment for new gear. On economic policymaking, these commissions have crowded out the influence of the State Council. Since a tweak in rules last year, the council’s executives meet only two or three times a month, rather than every week.

如果李总理失去了影响力，那么谁获得了权力呢？显而易见的答案是何立峰，另一位副总理，已成为习近平的经济大管家。何先生来自福建省，习近平在那里度过了他职业生涯的17年。在厦门这座港口城市，他们成为了朋友和同事。何先生甚至是习近平的第二次婚礼上的一位客人。

If Mr Li has lost clout, who has gained it? The obvious answer is He Lifeng, another deputy prime minister, who has become Mr Xi’s economic tsar. Mr He (pictured, left) hails from the province of Fujian, where Mr Xi spent 17 years of his career. In Xiamen, a port city, they became friends and colleagues. Mr He was even a guest at the future president’s second wedding.

根据美国智库“宏观政策思考”的观察，何立峰是党的三个财经委员会的办公室主任。他还是两个监管金融体系和监管机构的较低委员会的成员。这些委员会的愿景在党的主要理论刊物《求是》上进行了总结。该文坚持认为金融要服务于“实体”经济，警示金融领域“拜金主义”危害，强调金融风险可能具有传染性、隐蔽性和破坏性。一位经济学家表示：“习近平在某种程度上不喜欢西装革履的金融人。”

Mr He holds a position on three of the party’s financial commissions, notes Macropolo, a think-tank in America. He is the office director of CFEAC. He also sits on two lower commissions that oversee the financial system and its regulators. The commissions’ vision was summed up in an article in *Qiushi*, the party’s main theoretical journal, in December. It insisted that finance serve the “real” economy, warned about the dangers of “pseudo-innovation” in the sector, and emphasised that financial risks can be infectious, hidden and destructive. “Xi Jinping, at some level, does not like finance people with fancy suits and nice shoes,” says one economist.

去年，何立峰主导任命了李云泽为中国新金融领域的监管机构负责人，该机构覆盖银行和保险。这个新机构还接管了以往由中国人民银行负责的一些监管职责。中央银行从未像其他地方的货币当局一样享有自主性和地位。尽管其行长潘功胜拥有博士学位，可能比他的上级中的任何一位政策制定者都更懂经济。但该银行似乎正失去员工和地位。

Mr He last year oversaw the appointment of Li Yunze as the head of China’s new financial super-regulator, which covers both banking and insurance. This new body has also taken on some of the supervisory responsibilities previously held by the People’s Bank of China. The central bank has never enjoyed the autonomy or stature granted to monetary authorities elsewhere. Its governor, Pan Gongsheng, holds a PhD and is probably a better economist than any of the policymakers above him. But the bank nonetheless appears to be losing staff and status.

美国另一智库亚洲协会政策研究所的“解码中国政治”项目指出，何立峰与中国经济政策制定机构的官员们之间有着个人联系。在福建厦门大学时是何立峰同窗的刘昆直到2023年担任财政部长，并帮助选拔了现任财政部长蓝佛安的职务。中国反垄断机构负责人罗雯在何立峰担任国家发展和改革委员会主任期间担任副职一年。

According to “Decoding Chinese Politics”, a project of the Asia Society Policy Institute, another think-tank in America, Mr He has personal links with officials across China’s economic-policymaking apparatus. Liu Kun, his classmate at Xiamen University in Fujian, served as finance minister until 2023 and helped pick the current holder of that office, Lan Fo’an. The head of China’s anti-monopoly agency, Luo Wen, spent a year as Mr He’s deputy when he was head of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s main planning agency.

国家发展和改革委员会的现任主任郑善洁也来自福建省，并在厦门市何立峰的领导下工作过。他曾批评另一沿海城市的地方官员的自满态度。他说：“如果你不进步，你就在退步；如果你进步慢，你也在退步。”他自己的进步也是令人印象深刻的。1997年，他是一个鱼肝油厂的经理，从设备维护的工作一步步晋升。

The current head of the NDRC, Zheng Shanjie, also comes from Fujian province and worked under Mr He in Xiamen. He once criticised local officials in another coastal city for their complacency. “If you don’t make progress, you are regressing; if you progress slowly, you are regressing.” His own progress has been impressive. In 1997, he was the manager of a cod-liver-oil factory, having risen up the ranks from a job in equipment maintenance.

在今年的中国发展论坛上，郑善洁和他的导师何立峰都敦促外国商界人士投资于中国的“新生产力”，提供了这个国家广阔市场和雄心勃勃的创新计划所提供的机遇。一位面带微笑的何先生被拍到正在与黑石集团、辉瑞、康宁和西门子等公司的老板握手，这是在一处靠近一座皇帝钓鱼的客堂外的照片。如果外国企业想知道中国领导人的措施，何立峰是必见之人。现在，他们会接受吗？ ■

At this year’s China Development Forum, both Mr Zheng and his mentor, Mr He, urged foreign businesspeople to invest in China’s “new productive forces”, dangling the opportunities offered by the country’s vast market and ambitious programme of innovation. A smiling Mr He was pictured shaking hands with bosses from Blackstone, Pfizer, Corning and Siemens outside a guesthouse on the site, near where an emperor used to fish. If foreign businesses want to know what line China’s leaders are casting, Mr He is the person to see. Now, will they bite? ■



<hr><span style="color: red;"><b>中国 | 三体羞耻</b></span> (China | Three-body shaming)

中国民族主义者对“三体问题”有意见 (Chinese nationalists have issues with “3 Body Problem”)
=======================================================================

该节目在西方大获成功。但其历史教训并非人人接受。 (The show is a hit in the West. But its history lesson is not for everyone)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Zine Tseng在Netflix系列剧《三体问题》中饰演年轻的叶文洁](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_CNP001.jpg)

这本书充满了**技术术语**，大量涉及**粒子加速器**和**纳米技术**的参考。故事讲述地球为外星人入侵做准备，非常黑暗。然而，刘慈欣的《**三体问题**》自2008年出版以来在中国大获成功。这本小说于2014年被翻译成英文，很快在西方获得了奖项和粉丝。当美国流媒体巨头Netflix在2020年宣布将这部小说改编成高成本电视系列时，大多数读者都感到高兴。

The book is full of technical jargon, with copious references to particle accelerators and nanotechnology. The story, about Earth preparing for an alien invasion, is dark. Nevertheless, “The Three-Body Problem” by Liu Cixin has been a huge hit in China since it was published in 2008. It was translated into English in 2014 and quickly gathered awards and fans in the West, too. Most readers rejoiced when Netflix, an American streaming giant, announced in 2020 that it was turning the novel into a big-budget television series.

这部名为“**3体问题**”的系列于3月21日在美国上线，获得了积极的评价。Netflix在中国受阻，但该国许多人通过盗版网站或可以绕过官方互联网控制的软件观看了该节目。它成为微博（一个社交媒体平台）上最热门的话题之一。许多评论者似乎喜欢这个版本（之前在中国制作过一部改编作品）。然而，国家主义者并不欢迎。

The series, called “3 Body Problem”, launched on March 21st to positive reviews in America. Netflix is blocked in China. But many in the country managed to watch the show using pirate sites or software that can bypass official internet controls. It became one of the hottest-trending topics on Weibo, a social-media platform. Many commenters seemed to like this version (a previous adaptation was produced in China). Nationalists, however, did not.

国家主义者很容易感到不满，他们不满于Netflix删除了小说中的一些中国元素。在这个系列中，许多情节发生在伦敦和牛津，而在书中，北京占据更重要地位。同样，在节目中，一些中国角色被讲英语的西方人取代了。

Quick to take offence, the nationalists were unhappy that Netflix dropped some of the Chinese elements of the novel. In the series, much of the action takes place in London and Oxford, whereas in the book Beijing features more heavily. Similarly, in the show some Chinese characters have been replaced with English-speaking Westerners.

但国家主义者感到不满的主要原因与Netflix在节目中保留的内容有关。第一集始于上世纪60年代的**文化大革命**。一个叫叶文洁的年轻角色（如图）目睹了她的父亲，一位物理教授，因拒绝放弃科学支持马克思主义而被**红卫兵**（毛派青年团体）殴打致死。这一经历让她对人类失去了信心。

But the main reason nationalists are upset has to do with something that Netflix left in the show. The first episode begins in the 1960s, during the Cultural Revolution. A young character called Ye Wenjie (pictured) witnesses her father, a physics professor, getting beaten to death by Red Guards (Maoist youth gangs) for refusing to renounce science in favour of Marxism. The experience causes her to lose faith in humanity.

这一场景受令人沉重的历史事实启发--许多学者在那个时期被他们的学生谋杀。它也是小说的重要部分。刘先生不得不将这一场景安排在中间，以安抚中国审查机构。但它在英文翻译中是开篇。国家主义者不在乎。“为什么中国的错误要永远被记住呢？”网上一名人士抱怨道。另一人则说Netflix“只是借口这么一锅醋，制作了这部电视剧”，暗示这部系列是为了让中国看起来糟糕而制作的。

The scene is inspired by grim historical facts—many academics were killed by their students during that period. It is also an important part of the novel. Mr Liu had to bury it in the middle in order to placate Chinese censors. But it comes at the beginning of the English translation. The nationalists do not care. “Why should China’s mistakes be remembered for ever?” complained one online. Netflix “made a batch of dumplings just as an excuse for using this vinegar”, said another, suggesting that the series was produced only to make China look bad.

值得一提的是，中国的国家主义者并非反对刘慈欣作品的所有改编。他们往往喜欢2019年上映的以中文为语言的电影《流浪地球》，该片改编自另一部小说。与“**3体问题**”一样，赌注很高。一群宇航员必须阻止地球与木星碰撞。但英雄们全是中国人，并且电影设定在未来。■

China’s nationalists, mind you, are not opposed to all adaptations of Mr Liu’s work. They tended to like “The Wandering Earth”, a Chinese-language film released in 2019 that was based on a different novel. As in “3 Body Problem”, the stakes are high. A group of astronauts has to stop Earth from colliding with Jupiter. But the heroes are all Chinese and the film is set in the future. ■

**美国人将于11月选举 471 名联邦官员：435 名众议院成员、34 位参议员、一名副总统和一名总统。这些竞争活动被即将到来的总统乔·拜登和他的前任唐纳德·特朗普之间的再次对决所掩盖，这场对决将被宣传为民主与专制之间的斗争（并将通过约 30 亿美元的竞选支出放大）。为期七个月的这场较量势必将令人疲惫。

AMERICANS WILL elect 471 federal officials in November: 435 members of the House of Representatives, 34 senators, a vice-president and a president. These contests are overshadowed by the [impending rematch](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election) between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump, his predecessor, which will be pitched as a struggle between democracy and autocracy (and amplified by a projected $3bn in campaign spending). Seven months of this promises to be wearing.

然而，如果你眼光转向选票，就会发现一些琢磨不定的事情。目前，华盛顿的政治力量对比极其微弱。民主党仅以 100 个席位中的两席之差控制着参议院，而共和党在 435 个众议院席位中控制着五席（一旦威斯康星州的迈克·加拉格（Mike Gallagher）下个月退休，这个差额将缩小到四席）。

Cast your eye down the ballot, however, and something exotic is in the offing. At the moment, Washington is divided by the thinnest of margins. Democrats control the Senate by just two seats out of 100. Republicans control the House of Representatives by five out of 435 (a margin that will shrink to four once Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin retires next month).

选举之后，两个议会的控制权可能会发生变动。在参议院，今年争夺的席位处于极为有利的共和党州。相比之下，在众议院，民主党可能会通过抨击共和党领导的混乱来夺回控制权。这样的双重转变将是一项相当了不起的政治体操壮举：这种情况以前从未发生过。

After the election, control of both chambers could flip. In the Senate, the seats contested this year are in extremely favourable states for Republicans. In the House, by contrast, Democrats campaigning against the chaos of Republican leadership may wrest back control. A double flip would be quite a feat of political gymnastics: it has never happened before.

参议院任期为六年，每两年只有三分之一的席位进行选举。今年的组合对民主党不利。西弗吉尼亚州参议员乔·曼钦（Joe Manchin），在其热爱特朗普的州保持了民主党代表的地位，即将退休。他的席位几乎肯定会被共和党填补，使得竞选的起点在实质上是五五开。

Senate terms last six years, and only one-third are contested every two years. The mix this year is unkind to Democrats. Joe Manchin, the West Virginia senator who managed to remain the Democratic representative of his Trump-loving state, is retiring. His seat will almost certainly be filled by a Republican, leaving the starting-point for the race at, in essence, 50-50.

在这一轮七场有竞争力的参议院席位中，目前全部由民主党掌握。其中五个位于总统竞选摇摆州（亚利桑那州、密歇根州、内华达州、宾夕法尼亚州和威斯康辛州）。这些席位对民主党是可以取胜的，但都不是十拿九稳的（参见图表）。在蒙大拿州和俄亥俄州，拜登很可能会失败，但现任的民主党参议员乔恩·特斯特（Jon Tester）和谢罗德·布朗（Sherrod Brown）必须取胜，以保持该党对该议院的控制。他们是各自州仅存的担任州级职务的民主党人。为民主党增添麻烦的是，马里兰州受欢迎的共和党前州长拉里·霍根（Larry Hogan）计划竞选该州的参议员席位。

Of the seven competitive Senate races this cycle, all are now held by Democrats. Five are in presidential battleground states (Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). They are winnable by Democrats, but none comfortably (see chart). In Montana and Ohio Mr Biden is likely to lose, but the incumbent Democratic senators, Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown, must prevail if the party is to retain control of the chamber. They are the last remaining Democrats holding statewide office in their respective states. Adding to the Democrats’ headaches, Larry Hogan, a popular Republican ex-governor of ordinarily deep-Democratic Maryland, plans to run for its Senate seat.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_USC056.png)

与此同时，共和党现任议员看起来较为稳固。对于民主党而言，唯一有一丝机会推翻的两人分别是德克萨斯州的泰德·克鲁兹（Ted Cruz）和佛罗里达州的瑞克·斯科特（Rick Scott），而这两个州都不是拜登认真考虑的竞选州。因此，总体来看，数学对民主党而言看起来颇为令人担忧。他们需要进行完美的防守，才能达到 50-50 的参议院格局（并且希望卡玛拉·哈里斯继续担任副总统以施压朝自己有利的方向）。

Republican incumbents, meanwhile, look comfortable. The two that Democrats have the slightest chance of upsetting are Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida—neither of whom represents states that Mr Biden will be seriously contesting. Overall, then, the maths look troubling for Democrats. They will need to play perfect defence to get to a 50-50 Senate (and hope that Kamala Harris remains vice-president to break ties in their favour).

事实上，民主党曾在2022年中期选举中实现了这一壮举（实际上在宾夕法尼亚州获得了一席），他们期望保持筹款优势。而在以往选举中损害共和党的候选人素质问题可能会再次出现。例如，在亚利桑那州，2022年曾输给一位弱小的民主党竞争者的选举否定狂的卡丽·莱克（Kari Lake）很可能会成为该党的参议院候选人。在宾夕法尼亚州，预期的共和党候选人戴维·麦科米克（Dave McCormick）在2022年昂贵的参议院初选中输给了名人医生梅赫梅特·奥兹（Mehmet Oz），他因私人飞机飞往康涅狄格州的豪宅而饱受被指责。

True, the Democrats managed this feat in the midterms of 2022 (actually gaining one seat, in Pennsylvania). They expect to retain their fundraising advantages. And the candidate-quality issues that hurt Republicans in previous elections may recur. In Arizona, for example, Kari Lake, an election-denying demagogue who in 2022 lost her bid for governor against a weak Democratic challenger, will probably be the party’s Senate candidate. In Pennsylvania Dave McCormick, the presumptive Republican nominee who lost an expensive Senate primary in 2022 to a celebrity doctor, Mehmet Oz, is dogged by allegations of carpet-bagging over his private-jet travel to his mansion in Connecticut.

众议院的选举对共和党的不利程度不及参议院选举对民主党的不利。但民主党比共和党更有可能夺得该议会的理由更加充分，原因有多个。

The House elections are not so tilted against the Republicans as the Senate elections are against the Democrats. But Democrats have a more credible case for taking the chamber than the Republicans do for keeping it, for a number of reasons.

首先，共和党对众议院的管辖混乱程度甚至连国会的低标准都算不上。去年，共和党强硬派首次在美国历史上罢黜了他们的众议院议长。上周，他们派出一人提出罢免现任议长的动议。更常规的力量也对共和党构成不利。预计民主党将在支出上超过共和党。在选举拜登的区域中有超过十二名共和党议员；而在拜登友好的区域只有五名民主党议员。

First, Republican stewardship of the House has been chaotic, even by the low standards of Congress. Last year, for the first time in American history, Republican hardliners deposed their speaker. Last week one of their ranks, Marjorie Taylor Greene, introduced a motion to depose the current speaker. More ordinary forces also militate against Republicans. Democrats are expected to outspend them. And there are over a dozen Republicans in districts that voted for Mr Biden; there are only five Democrats in Trump-friendly districts.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_USC055.png)

尽管美国政治已经在强烈的国家化和两极化的形势下，议会倾向于支持的党派已经趋于稳定，成为狭窄而不稳定的局面。在 1932 年至 1994 年间，民主党控制众议院的时间长达 4 年。自那时起，该议会已经五次交替党派控制。轻微变动，如投票率的小幅变化、第三方候选人的进入，可能会产生决定性的影响。

The possible flip-flopping of the chambers may seem odd when American politics are so nationalised and polarised. Split-ticket voting—in which people vote for presidential candidates of one party and congressional candidates of another—has gone from common to exceptional. In roughly one-third of the Senate races held in the presidential-election years of 1992, 1996 and 2000, voters opted for a presidential candidate of one party and a senator of the other. In 2016 there were no such cases. And in the 33 elections held in 2020 the sole exception was in Maine.

议会的翻转对于创新产生重要影响。共和党对参议院的控制意味着特朗普先生如若重新获得白宫，将更容易确认他最离谱的潜在提名人选。而如果连任的拜登先生可能会发现，他提名的填补司法空缺的人选被拒绝。

Split congressional districts have also declined precipitously. Before 2000 well over 100 districts typically had representatives belonging to a different party from the voters’ presidential preference. By 2020 this had declined to a record low of 16.

眼下，共和党参议员们更为国际主义，因此通过另一种割裂的政府可能会支持乌克兰。但总的来说，分裂的政府往往不利于严肃的立法活动，就像 2015 年后奥巴马总统与共和党控制的参议院之间发生的拉锯战那样。

But as American politics have calcified into two mutually loathing teams of nearly equal size, legislative majorities that were once enduring have become narrow and unstable. Between 1932 and 1994, Democrats controlled the House for all but four years. Since then the chamber has flipped party control five times. Minor fluctuations—small shifts in turnout, the entry of a [third-party candidate](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/03/07/third-party-candidates-could-tip-americas-presidential-election)—can be decisive.

对国会山的竞争尚未引起大量公众关注。也许应该值得。尽管美国人对于下一位总统的问题非常关注，但他们对于他是否能够在位掌握多少实际权力却付出了令人惊讶的少量精力。 ■

A double flip would matter for more than just novelty. Republican control of the Senate would mean that Mr Trump, if he regains the White House, would have a far easier time confirming his most outlandish potential nominees. Mr Biden, if re-elected, could find that his nominees to fill judicial vacancies were refused.

Republican senators are, for the moment, more [internationalist](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/26/the-republican-party-no-longer-believes-america-is-the-essential-nation) than their House colleagues, so aid for Ukraine could pass through a differently divided government. But on the whole, divided government tends to be inimical to serious legislating—as experienced in the tug-of-war between President Barack Obama and the Republican-controlled Senate after 2015.

The competition for Capitol Hill has not yet attracted a great deal of public interest. Perhaps it should. For all the attention that Americans pay to the question of their next president, they devote surprisingly little to whether or not he will be able to do much from his perch. ■

“Stormy Daniels案件”呼应过去丑闻 (The case of Stormy Daniels echoes past scandals)
=======================================================================

应促使所有相关人员检视自身的正直。 (It should make all involved check their righteousness)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

![唐纳德·特朗普和比尔·克林顿站在暴风云下，分别注视着斯蒂芬妮·克利福德和莫妮卡·莱温斯基](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_USD000.jpg)

将近30年前的1994年5月，一位阿肯色州前办事员保拉·琼斯对总统比尔·克林顿提起了性骚扰诉讼。她说，1991年，当时作为阿肯色州州长的克林顿把她引诱到小岩城的一间旅馆房间，拉下裤子，要求她做出某种性行为，但她拒绝了。

Almost 30 years ago, in May 1994, a former Arkansas state clerk, Paula Jones, filed a sexual-harassment suit against President Bill Clinton. She said that in 1991, as governor of Arkansas, he lured her to a hotel room in Little Rock, pushed down his trousers and urged her to perform a sex act, but she rebuffed him.

克林顿否认了这个故事，他的律师表示他在任期内免于民事诉讼。一位联邦法官最终驳回了琼斯女士的诉讼，但在最高法院拒绝了克林顿先生关于免责的论点之前，发现——令人发笑的是——这起诉讼只是个轻微干扰。事实上，做为由独立检察官肯·斯塔尔主持的调查的一部分（这个调查被称为“白水”），关于克林顿与白宫实习生莫妮卡·莱温斯基有关的信息在琼斯女士的律师之间进行秘密传递。

Mr Clinton denied the story, and his lawyers said he was immune to civil litigation while in office. A federal judge eventually threw out Ms Jones’s claim, but not before the Supreme Court rejected Mr Clinton’s argument about immunity, finding—hilariously—that the suit would be a minimal distraction. In fact, information was secretly passing between the investigation by Ken Starr, the independent counsel in the ever-branching inquiry known as Whitewater, and Ms Jones’s lawyers.

在琼斯案中，这些律师在克林顿先生作证时询问他是否与白宫实习生莫妮卡·莱温斯基有关，他的否认导致了有关伪证和妨碍司法的指控，共和党控制的众议院对他进行了弹劾。参议院在1999年以跨党派投票对他进行了无罪裁定。对于像列克星敦一样在那几年里艰难地经历了性、政治和法律纷争，然后在2001年9月11日的明朗清晨仰望天空，想知道自己是否一直以来都把优先事项处理得当的人来说，看一部关于斯蒂芬妮·克利福德的新纪录片《暴风》时，难免产生些许似曾相识之感。

Those lawyers asked during Mr Clinton’s deposition in the Jones case whether he had been involved with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, and his denial led to the charges of perjury and obstruction for which the Republican House of Representatives impeached him. The Senate acquitted him in 1999 in a bipartisan vote. For anyone, like Lexington, who slogged through the sexual, political and legal muck of those years, then looked up on the bright clear morning of September 11th 2001 to wonder if they had always had their priorities just right, it is hard not to watch a new documentary about Stephanie Clifford, “Stormy”, without some sense of déjà vu.

克利福德曾以脱衣舞女和色情演员Stormy Daniels的名义表演，称唐纳德·特朗普在2006年一场名人高尔夫锦标赛中与她发生性关系。在2016年总统选举前夕，特朗普的律师迈克尔·科恩支付了13万美元给克利福德签署一份保密协议。特朗普否认了克利福德的说法，但承认他曾偿还给科恩，以遏制她“虚假和勒索的指控”。这种偿还是下个月，如果按计划进行的话，将成为美国总统的[有史以来第一次刑事审判](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/03/23/the-cases-against-donald-trump-are-piling-up)。曼哈顿地方检察官阿尔文·布拉格指控特朗普伪造商业记录，以犯有一项他没有具体说明但似乎是违反联邦选举法的罪行。

Ms Clifford, who performed under the name Stormy Daniels as a stripper and porn actress, has said Donald Trump had sex with her during a celebrity golf tournament in 2006. On the eve of the presidential election in 2016 Mr Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid Ms Clifford $130,000 to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Mr Trump has denied Ms Clifford’s story but acknowledged he reimbursed Mr Cohen, to stifle her “false and extortionist accusations”. That reimbursement is the basis for what will be the [first-ever criminal trial](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/03/23/the-cases-against-donald-trump-are-piling-up) of an American president, if it starts as scheduled next month. The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, has accused Mr Trump of falsifying business records in order to commit another crime he has not specified, but which appears to be violating federal election law.

也许因为这一插曲涉及特朗普并且发生在社交媒体时代，这场戏剧看起来甚至比琼斯事件更加肮脏，中心女性所付出的代价似乎更大。克利福德现在欠特朗普超过60万美元，因为她输掉了一起诽谤诉讼，并需承担他律师的费用。她说她的律师违背她的意愿提起了诉讼。

Probably because this episode involves Mr Trump and has played out in the social-media era, the drama seems even tawdrier and the price paid by the woman at the centre seems even greater than in the saga of Ms Jones. Ms Clifford now owes Mr Trump more than $600,000 because she lost a defamation suit against him and is liable for his lawyer’s fees. She has said her lawyer filed the suit against her wishes.

像琼斯一样，克利福德在路易斯安那州巴吞鲁日贫困长大，遭受着廉价贬义，被指为金-digger和荡妇。像琼斯，政治立场为共和党的克利福德表示自己没有政治议程。两位女性都在某些看似盟友的利用下遭受着抨击。与琼斯一样，克利福德在成为名人后被批评和支持。在《华尔街日报》揭露她对特朗普的指控后，她开始了“再次使美国兴奋”的脱衣表演巡回，并发现年长女性和同性恋者争相出现在她的表演现场。“这将是我一生中最美好的一天，”她在《暴风》中带着动情的诚意说，在准备登上“周末夜现场”节目时。

Like Ms Jones, Ms Clifford, who grew up poor in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was assailed as trailer trash, a gold-digger and a slut. Like Ms Jones, Ms Clifford, a registered Republican, said she had no political agenda. Both were exploited by some seeming allies. Also like Ms Jones, Ms Clifford was buoyed by (and attacked for) her new celebrity. After the *Wall Street Journal* revealed her claims about Mr Trump in January 2018, she embarked on a “Making America Horny Again” strip tour and discovered older women and gay men crowding her venues. “This is going to be the best day of my life,” she says in “Stormy”, with touching sincerity, as she prepares to appear on “Saturday Night Live”.

但这部纪录片中的画面，从未明亮，逐渐变暗。克利福德继续在路上不仅是为了支付账单，还是为了保护她的女儿免受骚动。她的婚姻破裂了。提起诽谤诉讼的律师迈克尔·阿文纳蒂竟从她那里侵吞资金（因对她和其他客户犯罪被判处19年监禁）。在粉丝意识到他们的钱可能会流向特朗普后，她的书稿收入减少。然后布拉格提出了指控，社交媒体上的侮辱演变为死亡威胁。克利福德在哭泣时展示了一些威胁：“去死吧”和“你刚签下了你的死亡判书”。

But the picture, never bright, steadily darkens during the documentary. Ms Clifford stays on the road not only to pay her bills but to protect her daughter from the uproar. Her marriage disintegrates. The lawyer who filed the defamation suit, Michael Avenatti, turns out to have embezzled from her (he is serving 19 years for crimes against her and other clients). Her book royalties dry up as fans realise their money might go to Mr Trump. Then Mr Bragg files his charges, and the insults on social media turn to death threats. Ms Clifford is shown, near tears, reading some aloud: “Kill yourself” and “You just signed your death warrant.”

对于右翼和左翼而言，特朗普似乎开启了新历史。在纪录片中，克林顿时代的先例被忽略了。这应使几乎每个人都感到不安。新闻媒体对琼斯的关注远不及对克利福德的兴趣。那时，共和党人为总统感到震惊，而包括许多女权主义者在内的民主党人为指控他的女性感到震惊。当时是一个保守的检察官似乎决心将一起民事诉讼变成刑事指控；现在是一个进步的检察官选择对前总统测试一个新的法律理论，后者是在联邦检察官决定不追究类似案件之后。当时被指控的宣称自己是受害者，并让检察官的选择成为他的政治优势。目前，这段历史正在重演。

Not just for the right but for the left it can seem as if history started anew with Mr Trump. In the documentary the precedent of the Clinton era goes unexplored. It ought to make just about everyone squirm. The establishment news media was less fascinated by Ms Jones at first than it was by Ms Clifford. Back then it was Republicans who were scandalised by the president, while Democrats, including many feminists, were scandalised by the women who accused him. Then it was a conservative prosecutor who seemed determined to whipsaw a civil complaint into criminal charges; now it is a progressive prosecutor electing to test a novel legal theory against a former president, after federal prosecutors chose not to pursue a similar case. Back then the accused claimed to be the victim and turned the prosecutor’s choice to his political advantage. So far that history is repeating itself.

需要悲怜的是，在《暴风》中唯一质疑自己选择的人是克利福德。她说她不是受害者，在她以为是晚餐约会时，特朗普出其不意地寻求性行为时，她顺从了。她说，当特朗普被偷听到说到在臭名昭著的“通往荣耀”的录音带上时“不会错”，即女性会让他为所欲为。她说：“这一切最难的部分是，我觉得我对每个可能在我之后出现的女人都有部分责任，”她在这个令人期待其他人在这个悲伤故事中执行的残酷自我反省中说。

Poignantly, the one person in “Stormy” heard questioning their choices is Ms Clifford. She has said she is not a victim, and that when Mr Trump surprised her by seeking sex during what she thought was an appointment for dinner, she complied. She says Mr Trump “wasn’t wrong” when he was overheard saying, on the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, that women would let him do what he wanted. “The hardest part about all of this is I feel like I’m partially responsible for every woman that could have come after me,” she says, in an act of brutal self-examination one longs for others in this sad story to perform instead.

即使考虑到纪录片的同情观点，克利福德的勇气也是不言而喻的。她说她不会放弃“因为我在说实话”。但她为她的生活所消耗的骚动提供一个摧毁的结局：“这毫无意义，”她说，“我一点希望都没有了。”■

Even allowing for the documentary’s sympathetic viewpoint, Ms Clifford’s courage is unmistakable. She says she will not give up “because I’m telling the truth”. But she offers a devastating coda for the furore that has consumed her life. “This is just pointless,” she says. “I have no hope at all, any more.” ■

非法移民有权拥有枪支吗？ (Do undocumented immigrants have the right to own guns?)
==================================================================

芝加哥的一家联邦法院做出了部分非法移民有这个权利的决定。共和党人感到愤怒。 (A federal court in Chicago decides that some do. Republicans are outraged)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![央视播出枪击画面](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_USP004.jpg)

2020年6月1日的夜晚在芝加哥异常混乱。一周前，明尼阿波利斯一名警察谋杀了乔治·弗洛伊德，导致反对警察暴行的抗议活动遍布全球。就在一天前，当时的市长洛里·莱特芬特首次自1968年骚乱以来请求国民警卫队的帮助。在这种情况下，当时28岁的木匠赫里贝托·卡巴哈尔-弗洛雷斯借了一把枪，加入了一群男子，保卫着一家轮胎店，防止窃贼前来劫掠，这家店位于墨西哥社区小村（Little Village）。晚上11点左右，在一部摄像头的全景镜头前，卡巴哈尔-弗洛雷斯向一辆飞驰而过的白色轿车朝着方向开了七枪。四十分钟后，他被逮捕。

The night of June 1st 2020 was a chaotic one in Chicago. A week earlier, George Floyd had been murdered by a Minneapolis police officer, and protests against police brutality had spread all over the world. A day before, the then mayor, Lori Lightfoot, had requested help from the National Guard for the first time since the riots of 1968. Such was the situation when Heriberto Carbajal-Flores, a then-28-year-old carpenter, borrowed a gun and joined a group of men defending a tyre shop in Little Village, a Mexican neighbourhood, from would-be looters. At around 11pm, in full view of a camera, Mr Carbajal-Flores shot seven times in the direction of a white car that was speeding past. Forty minutes later, he was arrested.

到目前为止，这只是那个炎热夏夜的疯狂故事之一。但是卡巴哈尔-弗洛雷斯对财产的相当鲁莽防卫可能会改变美国。今年三月初，在芝加哥，最初对他提起的所有指控都被一位联邦法官驳回。卡巴哈尔-弗洛雷斯是一名墨西哥公民，作为一个儿时非法抵达美国的人，他被指控违反了禁止无证移民（以及持临时签证的外国人）拥有枪支的联邦法律。法官沙龙·约翰逊·科尔曼判定，对他而言，这项法律是违宪的。她引用了美国独立战争时期允许前英国拥护者携带枪支的案例，辩称卡巴哈尔-弗洛雷斯有权接受“个性化评估”，确认他是否有权拥有枪支；就他的情况而言，他有这个权利。

So far, just another story of madness on that hot summer night. But Mr Carbajal-Flores’s rather reckless defence of property may yet change America. In early March the last of the charges originally filed against him was dismissed by a federal judge in Chicago. Mr Carbajal-Flores, a Mexican citizen who arrived illegally in America as a child, was accused of breaking the federal law which bans undocumented immigrants (as well as foreigners on temporary visas) from owning guns. The judge, Sharon Johnson Coleman, ruled that, as applied to him, the law was unconstitutional. Citing cases of former British loyalists in the revolutionary war who were allowed guns, she argued that Mr Carbajal-Flores was entitled to an “individualised assessment” about whether he had a right to own a gun; and in his case, he did.

实际上，科尔曼女士裁定，一些无证移民有权持有枪支。尽管这几乎肯定会上诉，但这一裁决已经在共和党人中引发了轩然大波。来自佛罗里达州的共和党参议员马可·卢比奥质疑裁决是否“旨在嘲讽枪支法律，以及美国公民身份的整体理解”。这表明了一个保守派的重点，即拥有几乎没有限制的枪支所有权，可能即将与另一个重点相冲突：对无证移民的强烈厌恶。

In effect, Ms Coleman ruled that some undocumented immigrants are allowed to have guns. Though it will almost certainly be appealed, the ruling has already set off a storm among Republicans. Marco Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida, wondered if the ruling was “being done to sort of mock both gun laws and also the whole…understanding of the value of being a citizen of the United States”. It shows how one conservative priority, the right to gun ownership with few restrictions, may be about to crash into another: a strong dislike of undocumented migrants.

一个世代前，一个非法在美国的墨西哥人拥有携带枪支的宪法权利的想法被认为是荒谬的。但这个问题的出现得益于最高法院的保守判决，扩大了赋予美国人携带武器权利的第二修正案的范围。

A generation ago the idea that a Mexican illegally in America could have a constitutional right to carry a gun would have been considered absurd. Yet the question has arisen thanks to conservative rulings at the Supreme Court that have widened the scope of the Second Amendment, which gives Americans the right to bear arms.

首先是2008年的《哥伦比亚特区诉赫勒案》，裁定首都的手枪禁令是违宪的。然后是2022年的《纽约州步枪与手枪协会诉布鲁恩案》，裁定要求个人出示“合理理由”以获得[隐蔽携带许可证](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/23/americas-supreme-court-extends-the-right-to-bear-arms-outside-the-home)也是违宪的，以及任何缺乏1791年法律类似事项的枪支管控法律也是违宪的。现在，正如克拉伦斯·托马斯大法官所言，第二修正案不再是“一项由官员酌情给予的二等权利”。相反，它类似于第一修正案，保护了言论和宗教自由。

First, in 2008 there was *District of Columbia v Heller*, which ruled that a ban on handguns in the nation’s capital was unconstitutional. Then, in 2022, came *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v Bruen,* which ruled that requiring individuals to show “proper cause” to get a [concealed-carry permit](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/23/americas-supreme-court-extends-the-right-to-bear-arms-outside-the-home) was also unconstitutional, along with any gun-control law lacking an analogue in 1791. Now the Second Amendment is, in the words of Justice Clarence Thomas, no longer “a second-class right” to be given at the discretion of officials. Rather, it is comparable to, say, the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech and religion.

然而，宪法规定，携带武器的权利由“人民”持有，而不仅仅由公民持有。卡巴哈尔-弗洛雷斯的律师辩称，他们的客户是“人民”的一员，因为他与美国有联系。虽然他非法进入美国，但他有资格根据奥巴马签署生效的《梦想生效行政命令》免受驱逐出境的保护。他被逮捕后的周末，他与长期女友结婚，她是美国公民。他的子女是美国公民。他们还辩称，他特定使用武器来威慑劫匪，正是许多保守派所钦佩的行为。卡巴哈尔-弗洛雷斯表示，他是根据警方指示携带武器，他开的枪是警告性射击。卡巴哈尔-弗洛雷斯的律师之一罗斯·卡辛厄姆说：“我们的客户是一个合法的英雄。”“他就是那个传说中的拿枪的好人。”

Yet the constitution says that the right to bear arms is held by “the people”, and not merely by citizens. Mr Carbajal-Flores’s lawyers argue that their client is a member of “the people” by virtue of his ties to the United States. Though he entered America illegally, he is eligible for protection from deportation under daca, an executive order signed into effect by Barack Obama. The weekend after he was arrested he got married to his longtime girlfriend, who is an American citizen. His children are citizens. They also argue that his specific use of a weapon, to deter looters, was exactly the sort of behaviour that many conservatives admire. Mr Carbajal-Flores says he was instructed by the police to go armed, and the shots he fired were warning shots. “Our client is a legitimate hero,” says Ross Cassingham, one of Mr Carbajal-Flores’s lawyers. “He’s the proverbial good guy with a gun.”

在上诉中，政府律师可能会提出不同看法。在对辩护方的第一项解除请求的回应中，他们指出，卡巴哈尔-弗洛雷斯甚至在与警察交谈前就携带武器，并暗示他的枪击显然不仅仅是警告，因此他不是在合法自卫。他们还辩称，禁止无证移民拥有枪支的法律是合宪的，理由是《赫勒》裁定仍允许政府限制某些人群拥有枪支。他们还认为，对非公民的限制是合法的，理由是已经违反法律进入该国的人不能被信任拥有枪支。该论点最初被接受。

At appeal the government’s lawyers are likely to say otherwise. In their response to the defence’s first motion to dismiss, they noted that Mr Carbajal-Flores armed himself before he even spoke to the police and suggested his gunfire was not obviously intended only to warn, so he was not acting in legitimate self-defence. They also argued that the law banning undocumented migrants from owning guns is constitutional, on the basis that the *Heller* decision still allowed the government to restrict classes of people from owning firearms. And they contended that restrictions on non-citizens are legitimate, on the basis that people who have already broken the law in moving to the country cannot be trusted with firearms. That argument was initially accepted.

但这是在《布鲁恩》出现之前，该案实际上建立了一项测试，即枪支法律必须符合早期共和国的法律。因此，考虑到亚当·温克勒所指出的，18世纪末非法移民的概念几乎不存在，因此“人民”包括美国国内的每个人。加州大学洛杉矶分校法学院的亚当·温克勒表示：“可以明显看出，无证移民有言论自由和宗教自由的权利。”“因此出于一致性考虑，人们应该认为他们也有第二修正案的权利。”

But that came before *Bruen*, which in effect established a test that gun laws must be in line with the laws of the early republic. Hence Judge Coleman’s consideration of how British loyalists were treated after the revolutionary war. In the late 18th century, notes Adam Winkler, of the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law, the concept of illegal immigration hardly existed, and so “the people” included everybody inside the United States. “It is clear that undocumented immigrants have a right to free speech and free religion,” says Mr Winkler. “So for purposes of consistency, one would imagine they would have Second Amendment rights.”

接下来会发生什么？最高法院很快将决定另一个[案例](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/09/the-supreme-court-has-found-a-gun-control-measure-it-likes)，即家庭暴力者在限制令下是否可以被限制拥有枪支；这可能会为卡巴哈尔-弗洛雷斯案提供一些线索。最终的决定可能具有重大影响。例如，目前，伊利诺伊州要求任何想要拥有枪支的人都必须申请许可证，并禁止没有绿卡的外国人申请。如果被维持，这一裁决可能迫使该州考虑几乎每个人。因此，人们像卢比奥先生一样感到愤怒。

What happens next? Another [case in the Supreme Court](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/09/the-supreme-court-has-found-a-gun-control-measure-it-likes) will soon decide whether domestic abusers under restraining orders can be restricted from owning guns; that may give some hints as to how the Carbajal-Flores case could be resolved. A final decision could have big implications. At the moment, for example, the state of Illinois requires anyone who wants a gun to apply for a licence, and bans foreigners without green cards from applying. If upheld, this ruling could force the state to consider almost anyone. Hence the outrage of people like Mr Rubio.

然而，正如温克勒先生指出的，对此反弹有一种讽刺意味。保守派通常认为枪支管制法律并不能阻止犯罪分子购买枪支。但当他们不喜欢的人开始行使这些权利时，保守派并不总是那么热衷于广泛的枪支权利。1967年，加利福尼亚州禁止携带已装弹的枪，试图解除黑豹党携带步枪的武装。签署这项法律的州长正是罗纳德·里根。对于枪支的看法可能会改变，即使是在共和党人当中。■

Yet as Mr Winkler notes, there is an irony to the backlash. Conservatives usually argue that gun-control laws do not stop criminals from buying guns anyway. But then conservatives have not always been so keen on widespread gun rights—at least when people they dislike start exercising them. In 1967 California banned the carrying of loaded guns, in an attempt to disarm the rifle-carrying Black Panther Party. The governor who signed the law was none other than Ronald Reagan. Views on guns can change, even among Republicans. ■

格鲁吉亚的黑人共和党人为2024年制定了一项作战计划 (Georgia’s black Republicans have a battle plan for 2024)

乔·拜登今年将不得不更加努力赢得该州的黑人选民。 (Joe Biden will have to work harder to win the state’s black voters this year)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![支持者参加特朗普在乔治亚举办的竞选集会。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_USP002.jpg)

在黑人历史月的最后一个星期日，亚特兰大以贝尼撒街浸信会教堂里充满了真正的能量。在让即使是无神论的通讯员也感受到宗教感的福音歌曲之间，三个孩子提醒了教会的会众该教堂在政治上的重要性。马丁·路德·金是在那里受洗并在那里布道直至去世。多年来，教堂成员成为了立法者，如今，一个小女孩笑着告诉会众，乔治亚第一位黑人参议员是他们的牧师。坐在她后面的[拉斐尔·沃诺克](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/12/08/what-democrats-and-republicans-can-learn-from-raphael-warnock)是乔治亚州两名令2021年初参议院控制权翻转的桃州民主党人之一，他向她伸出了拳头，鼓起掌声。

On the last Sunday of Black History Month there was real energy in Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church. Between gospel songs that made even your agnostic correspondent feel something spiritual, a trio of children reminded the congregation of the church’s political prominence. Martin Luther King junior was baptised there and preached there until he died. Over the years church members became lawmakers, and today a little girl told parishioners, with a grin, that Georgia’s first black senator is their pastor. Sitting behind her [Raphael Warnock](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/12/08/what-democrats-and-republicans-can-learn-from-raphael-warnock), one of two Peach State Democrats who helped flip control of the Senate in early 2021, reached out for a fist-bump as cheers erupted in the pews.

前一晚，一批截然不同的黑人乔治亚人聚在一起。在一个改建的市中心仓库，乔治亚黑人共和党理事会举办了有史以来第一次的化装舞会。牧场主和代表上台发表特朗普式的演讲。身着红色亮片礼服和毛皮披肩的女士们一边啃着炸鸡，一边聊着他们打算让朋友打破传统，在11月份投票给共和党。

The night before a very different set of black Georgians had come together. In a converted downtown warehouse the Georgia Black Republican Council held its first-ever masquerade ball. Ranchers and representatives took to the stage to give Trumpian speeches. Women dressed in red sequinned gowns and fur stoles nibbled at fried chicken while chatting about their plans to get friends to break with tradition and vote Republican in November.

**乔治亚有大约30%的黑人选民，是所有争取选票的州中黑人选民比例最高的。** 在过去的二十年里，大量黑人涌入亚特兰大都会地区，让乔治亚成为唯一一个民主党可以竞争的深南部州。2020年，乔·拜登成为自1992年以来首位在那里赢得的民主党总统候选人。但随着拜登与特朗普即将再次对决，民主党人担心他们在失去与他们最忠诚的投票群体的联系。

At roughly 30%, Georgia has the highest share of black voters of any battleground state. Over the past two decades an influx of black people into metro-Atlanta made Georgia the only Deep South state that Democrats can compete in. In 2020 Joe Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win there since 1992. But with a Biden-Trump rematch looming, Democrats fear they are [losing ground](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/17/why-non-white-voters-are-abandoning-the-democratic-party) with their most loyal voting bloc.

截至2023年，全国认为自己为民主党人的黑人男性比例从80%下降到62%。对于女性来说，这一比例从84%下降到74%。黑人年轻人对拜登先生尤为不满。乔治亚的共和党人看到了机会。2022年的州长竞选是首次两名候选人积极争取黑人选民。斯泰西·艾布拉姆斯花费了1亿美元来招揽他们，而最终击败她的布莱恩·肯普则派遣了黑人代理人，在黑人经营的企业展开竞选，并强调自己任命黑人法官的记录。去年12月，一群民主党策略家发布了一份报告，警告称即使今年黑人选民的投票率微降，也可能会让唐纳德·特朗普在该州获胜。

In the decade to 2023 the share of black men who identified as Democrats fell from 80% to 62% nationwide. For women it dropped from 84% to 74%. Black youngsters are particularly unenthused about Mr Biden. Republicans in Georgia see an opportunity. The governor’s race in 2022 was the first time that both candidates actively chased black voters. Stacey Abrams spent $100m courting them while Brian Kemp, who ultimately beat her, deployed black surrogates, campaigned at black-owned businesses and stressed his record of appointing black judges. In December a group of Democratic strategists published a report warning that even the slightest drop in black turnout this year could hand Donald Trump a victory in the state.

乔治亚的黑人共和党人认为三个问题可能会左右他们的同胞：教育、犯罪和移民。州代表梅莎·迈诺去年7月离开民主党成为共和党人，她表示黑人学生在失败的公立学校中受到了不成比例的影响。去年，亚特兰大的白人高中毕业率比黑人高出12个百分点。3月20日，州参议院通过了一项法案，提供家庭6500美元的私立学校学费津贴。她认为共和党为学校选择奋斗应该帮助他们争取各种政治立场的选民。

Georgia’s black Republicans think three issues can sway their brethren: education, crime and immigration. Mesha Mainor, a state representative who left the Democratic Party in July to become a Republican, says that black pupils suffer disproportionately from failing public schools. Last year Atlanta’s white high-school graduation rate was 12 percentage points above the black one. On March 20th the state Senate passed a bill to give families $6,500 vouchers for private-school tuition. She thinks Republicans’ crusade for school choice should help them pick up voters of all political stripes.

在犯罪问题上，黑人社区往往不支持自由派政策，乔治亚共和党计划利用这一点。过去一年来，亚特兰大一直在就修建一座价值9000万美元的警察训练设施“警察城”的计划展开争论。值得一提的是，一名黑人市议员提出了这一计划，该市黑人市长也支持了该计划，去年埃默里大学的一项调查发现，少数黑人居民反对了这一计划。乔治亚奥尔巴尼市的副警长兼市专员贾伦·约翰逊表示，他记不得有一次通知白人家庭有人去世。他表示，共和党对犯罪严厉的政策在“总是‘黑人男孩被枪击’的情况下”更容易引起共鸣。他指出，在特朗普总统任内，囚犯改革也取得了真正的进展。

On crime black communities tend not to favour liberal policies—and Georgia Republicans plan to capitalise on that. For the past year Atlanta has been divided over a plan to build a $90m police-training facility dubbed “cop city” by protesters. Notably, a black councilwoman proposed it, the city’s black mayor has endorsed it and an Emory University survey from last year found that a minority of black residents opposed it. Jalen Johnson, a deputy sheriff and city commissioner in Albany, Georgia, says he can’t remember a single time he has delivered a death notification to a white family. Republican tough-on-crime policies, he says, resonate more when it’s always “black boys getting shot”. He notes that during Mr Trump’s presidency there was also real progress on prison reform.

就在二月底，一名委内瑞拉移民因杀害雅典一名护理学生被捕后，三年前输给沃诺克先生失去参议员席位的凯利·洛夫勒在一家著名的亚特兰大灵魂食物餐厅召开了一次会议。晚餐过程中，黑人专家谈到了他们对拜登政府[在美国南部边界问题上的政策](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/25/how-the-border-could-cost-biden-the-election)感到的愤怒。一位黑人乔治亚人表示，他们看着亲人因为贩卖大麻而入狱，而非法潜入美国的移民却可以自由行动，甚至得到政府和非营利组织的支持。他们希望在这一轮中在黑人民主党人中引起同样的愤怒。

Days after a Venezuelan immigrant was arrested for killing a nursing student in Athens in late February, Kelly Loeffler, who lost her Senate seat to Mr Warnock three years ago, convened a meeting at a renowned Atlanta soul-food restaurant. Over dinner black panellists spoke about how resentful they feel about [Mr Biden’s policies](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/25/how-the-border-could-cost-biden-the-election) towards people who cross the southern border illegally. Black Georgians have watched loved ones go to jail for dealing marijuana, one said, while migrants who break the law by sneaking into America walk free and are even rewarded with government and non-profit aid. They hope to drum up that same anger in black Democrats in this cycle.

这个摇摆州的黑人选民仍然极度倾向于左翼。但年轻的转向保守事业的黑人乔治亚人决心传教。一群在化装舞会上的大学女性表示，他们将不再容忍候选人认为他们的选票理所当然。对于一些人来说，曾两次竞选乔治亚州州长的杰出黑人民主党人艾布拉姆斯教给他们，他们也在政治上有发声的权利。当他们深思之后，他们意识到他们被自己的政党利用了。

The swing state’s black electorate still leans overwhelmingly left. But the young black Georgians who have converted to the conservative cause are bent on evangelising. A band of college women at the masquerade ball said they will no longer tolerate candidates taking their votes for granted. For some it was Ms Abrams, a prominent black Democrat who ran for Georgia’s governor twice, who taught them that they, too, have a voice in politics. When they thought about it, they realised they were being played by their party.

“很多时候从一个兄弟开始，”现年25岁的迈克拉·蒙哥马利说道，她是在奥巴马总统任内长大的，现在负责管理一个名为BLEXIT的组织亚特兰大分部。“我们都信任他，因为他长得像我们，曾在我们教会演讲。”但这已经不够了。如果有一件事让她和担心失去乔治亚州的民主党策略家们达成一致，那就是拜登今年将不得不投入更大的力量和精力来赢得黑人选票。玩弄象征性的炸鱼晚宴的时代已经过去了。 ■

“A lot of times it started with a brother,” says Michaelah Montgomery, a 25-year-old who grew up during Barack Obama’s presidency and now runs the Atlanta chapter of an organisation called BLEXIT. “We all trusted him because he looked like us and spoke at our church.” But that is no longer enough. If there is one thing that she and the Democratic strategists worried about losing Georgia can agree on, it is that Mr Biden will have to spend bigger and work harder to get the black vote this year. The days of the token fish fry are over. ■

巴尔的摩桥梁灾难的影响 (The impact of the Baltimore bridge disaster)
======================================================

弗朗西斯·斯科特·基桥的倒塌将会对这座城市造成伤害，但也会突显出它的韧性 (The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge will hurt the city, but highlight its resilience, too)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![巴尔的摩的弗朗西斯·斯科特·基桥的钢架坍塌在集装箱船上](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_USP001.jpg)

**编辑注（3月27日）：** 马里兰州警方表示，弗朗西斯·斯科特·基桥坍塌后仍失踪的六人现在被视为已遇难。

***Editor’s note (March 27th):** Police in Maryland said that the six people who remain missing following the Key Bridge’s collapse are now presumed dead.*

巴尔的摩的弗朗西斯·斯科特·基桥坍塌的视频镜头令人震惊。在3月26日凌晨1点30分左右，一艘集装箱船撞击了其支撑柱之一，这座1.6英里（2.6公里）长的桥梁的中央部分坍塌进入下方的帕塔普斯科河，将人和车辆掉入水中。修补路面坑洼的工人当时正在桥上。“你永远不会想到会看到……基桥像那样倒塌”，巴尔的摩市长布兰登·斯科特对记者说。“看起来像是动作电影中的一幕”。

THE VIDEO footage of the collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge was shocking. At around 1.30am on March 26th, when a container ship rammed into one of its support columns, the central section of the 1.6-mile (2.6km) structure collapsed into the Patapsco river below, sending people and vehicles into the water. Workers repairing potholes were on the bridge at the time. “Never would you think that you would see…the Key Bridge tumble down like that,” Baltimore’s mayor, Brandon Scott, told reporters. “It looked like something out of an action movie.”

马里兰州州长宣布进入紧急状态。据美国土木工程师协会（ASCE）结构工程研究所所长杰里·哈贾尔称，六人被认为已经溺亡。除了人员伤亡以外，即时问题关注于这一灾难的原因和后果—据美国土木工程师协会（ASCE）的杰里·哈贾尔称，这是美国几十年来最严重的灾难之一。联邦调查局表示，恐怖袭击不太可能是原因。

Maryland’s governor declared a state of emergency. Six people are thought to have drowned. Beyond the human toll, the immediate questions concerned the causes and consequences of the disaster—one of the most significant in America for decades, according to Jerry Hajjar, president of the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). The FBI has said that terrorism was unlikely to have been behind it.

这艘长300米的*达利(Dali)*货船在驶往斯里兰卡科伦坡的途中“失去推进力”，根据一份未经分类的网络安全与基础设施安全局报告。据报道，船员通知官员可能发生桥梁碰撞。目击者表示，撞击前船上的灯光闪烁。当地居民在半夜听到巨大的雷鸣般的隆隆声。“房屋开始震动，”洛卡斯特角的居民赛勒斯·吉尔伯特说，该地点正好位于对面的港口。

The 300-metre-long ship, the *Dali*, was heading from Baltimore to Colombo, in Sri Lanka, when it “lost propulsion”, according to an unclassified Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency report. The crew reportedly notified officials that a bridge collision was likely. Eyewitnesses say the ship’s lights flickered just before impact. Locals heard a loud thunder-like rumble in the middle of the night. “The house started shaking,” says Cyrus Gilbert, a resident of Locust Point, directly across the harbour.

调查人员将想要了解为什么*达利*失去了控制权。 东北大学的纳达·桑德斯是全球供应链方面的专家，他说这艘船在去年6月曾有过一次检查问题。 根据船舶数据库Equasis的记录，智利当局曾就该船的推进和辅助机械给予“缺陷”评级（尽管后续在纽约的检查中未记录有缺陷）。

Investigators will want to know why the *Dali* lost control. Nada Sanders of Northeastern University, an expert on the global supply chain, says that the ship had an inspection issue last June. According to Equasis, a shipping database, Chilean authorities gave it a “deficiency” for propulsion and auxiliary machinery (though no deficiencies were recorded in a follow-up inspection in New York).

桥梁可能是结构上牢固的。根据ASCE的一份报告，2020年马里兰的桥梁得到了B级评分，港口得到了B-级评分。“桥梁并非设计用于承受船只在其柱上的横向载荷”，邓迪大学科学与工程学院的马素德·哈亚特达伍迪说。“毫无疑问，桥梁会因为对柱子的冲击而坍塌。”

The bridge could have been structurally sound. A report by the ASCE gave Maryland a B for its bridges and a B- for ports in 2020. “Bridges are not designed to withstand lateral loads from ships on their columns,” said Masoud Hayatdavoodi, of the University of Dundee’s School of Science and Engineering. “There is no question that the bridge would collapse due to the impact on the columns.”

乔·拜登总统承诺将承担重建桥梁的费用，尽快恢复。但对城市的影响已开始显现。港口已暂时关闭，这引发了波及整个港口以外的连锁反应。港口提供着逾15,000个直接就业岗位，大约140,000个就业岗位与之相关。 马里兰州陶森大学区域经济研究所的达拉乌斯·伊拉尼表示，仅港口的关闭可能每天造成大约5,000万美元的损失。

President Joe Biden promises to foot the bill to get the bridge rebuilt as soon as possible. But the impact on the city is already being felt. The port is closed until further notice, causing ripples beyond the harbour. The port supports over 15,000 direct jobs, and roughly 140,000 jobs are linked to it in some way. Daraius Irani, of the Regional Economic Studies Institute at Maryland’s Towson University, says the port closure alone will probably cost roughly $50m a day in lost activity.

港口是美国供应链的重要环节。 50多家海洋承运商每年进行近1800次访问。在汽车行业尤其重要。其私人和公共码头在2023年处理了近85万辆轿车和轻型卡车，是美国任何一个港口中最多的。它还在美国处理农场和建筑机械、进口糖和石膏方面名列第一，对煤炭出口来说名列第二。

The harbour is an important link in America’s supply chain. More than 50 ocean carriers make nearly 1,800 annual visits. It is especially important in the automotive world. Its private and public terminals handled nearly 850,000 cars and light trucks in 2023, the most of any American port. It also ranked first in the country in handling farm and construction machinery, as well as imported sugar and gypsum, and ranks second for coal exports.

如果另一个港口出现问题（例如劳资纠纷或网络攻击），对美国经济的影响可能是严重的。不过目前，全国范围内的影响可能有限。例如纽约-新泽西和弗吉尼亚等其他港口应能够弥补这一缺口。穆迪（Moody's）评级机构首席经济学家马克·赞迪表示，国家经济将不受影响，但巴尔的摩将受到影响。通勤者和卡车司机将面临中断。去年，这座桥每天服务34,000辆商用和客运车辆，占该地区15%的车流量。

If another port experienced a hiccup (because of labour disputes, say, or cyber-attacks), the toll on the American economy could be severe. For now, though, the national impact is likely to be limited. Other ports, such as New York-New Jersey and Virginia, should be able to pick up the slack. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s, a ratings agency, says the national economy will be OK, but Baltimore will suffer. Commuters and lorry drivers will face disruption. Last year the bridge served 34,000 commercial and passenger vehicles a day, about 15% of traffic in the area.

港口长期以来一直是韧性的象征。在1812年对抗英国的战争中，美国成功捍卫了位于巴尔的摩港的麦克亨利堡，这一事件被弗朗西斯·斯科特·基在他的19世纪诗中永远地铭记，该诗后来成为了国歌。这场悲剧将让城市和港口有时间进行升级改造，这在港口繁忙时会更加困难。巴尔的摩可能会以更好的桥梁和港口崛起。■

The harbour has long been a symbol of resilience. In the war of 1812 against the British, the Americans successfully defended Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbour, an event immortalised by Francis Scott Key in his 19th-century poem that became the national anthem. The tragedy will give the city and port time to implement upgrades that would be harder when the port is active. Baltimore may emerge with a better bridge and harbour. ■

芝加哥希望阻止格洛克手枪被改装成机关枪 (Chicago wants to stop Glock pistols being turned into machineguns)
====================================================================================

该市正在起诉制造商 (The city is suing the manufacturer)
-------------------------------------------

![Bruce Willis主演的《虎胆龙威2》中，手持一把格洛克手枪。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_USP003.jpg)

“那混球拔出了**格洛克**手枪。”布鲁斯·威利斯的角色在1990年代充满动作的圣诞经典电影《虎胆龙威2》中说道。“你知道那是什么吗？”你很可能知道。警察腰间的那把枪？很可能就是奥地利制造商**格洛克**生产的手枪。约翰·威克在心跳加速的场景中所使用的武器？其中至少有一把肯定是**格洛克**。从执法人员到好莱坞的犯罪分子，**格洛克**在流行文化中无处不在。它们也是现实生活中犯罪分子的首选枪支。这使得它们如此容易变成冲锋枪变得更加令人担忧。

“THAT PUNK pulled a Glock,” says Bruce Willis’s character in the action-packed 1990s Christmas classic “Die Hard 2”. “You know what that is?” You may well do. That gun on the hip of a police officer? It’s probably a pistol made by Glock, an Austrian manufacturer. That weapon in John Wick’s hands during a heart-thumping scene? One of them is definitely a Glock. From law enforcement to Hollywood lawbreakers, Glocks are everywhere in pop culture. They are also the gun of choice for real-life criminals. Which makes the fact that they can so easily be turned into machineguns that much more worrying.

3月19日，芝加哥市对**格洛克**提起了诉讼。犯罪分子使用廉价附件将**格洛克**手枪改装成冲锋枪。这种非法装置称为自动击钢块，但也被称为“**格洛克**开关”，尽管**格洛克**本身并没有制造这些产品。这些装置的大小如同一枚大硬币，可以低于一本精装书的价格购买，或者通过拥有3D打印机的任何人以更低的成本在家中制作。

On March 19th the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit against Glock. Using cheap add-ons, criminals are transforming Glock pistols into machineguns. The illegal device is called an auto sear, but it is also known as a “Glock switch”, though Glock does not make them. They are the size of a large coin, and they can be bought for less than a hardback book, or made at home by anyone with a 3D printer for much less.

这项诉讼是与致力于枪支改革的诉讼专家团体Everytown Law共同提起的，声称**格洛克**已经了解到这个问题，但仍未采取任何措施加以防止。“没有其他手枪设计像**格洛克**这样容易被改装成冲锋枪，”Everytown Law的执行董事埃里克·蒂尔希韦尔说。“那么为什么他们没有解决这个问题呢？”

The lawsuit, filed together with Everytown Law, a group of litigators specialising in gun reform, claims that Glock knows about the problem but has failed to prevent it anyway. “No other pistol design is so easily converted to a machinegun,” says Eric Tirschwell, the executive director of Everytown Law. “So why haven’t they fixed theirs?”

芝加哥以其街头暴力而臭名昭著，而疫情只是雪上加霜。尽管2023年的枪击案件较2022年下降了13％，但这座城市仍然面临着一波枪支暴力。去年有600多人丧生，尽管不是所有人都是被枪击所致，还有2400多起非致命枪击事件。芝加哥市声称**格洛克**正在让糟糕的情况变得更糟。该诉讼称，在2021年至2023年间，芝加哥警方缴获了1100支改装过的**格洛克**。

Chicago is notorious for its street violence, and the pandemic only made things worse. Though shootings fell by 13% in 2023 compared with 2022, the city is still facing a wave of gun violence. Last year more than 600 people were murdered, though not all by guns, and there were over 2,400 non-fatal shootings. The city of Chicago claims that Glock is making a bad situation worse. The lawsuit states that between 2021 and 2023, 1,100 modified Glocks were recovered by Chicago’s police.

全美步枪协会，即美国的枪支游说团体，不认同指责**格洛克**。“芝加哥的焦点应该放在罪犯身上，”该组织的临时首席执行官安德鲁·阿鲁兰安德姆说。“没有罪犯，就会减少犯罪。”

The National Rifle Association, America’s gun lobby, disagrees with blaming Glock. “Chicago’s focus ought to be on the criminals,” says Andrew Arulanandam, the group’s interim CEO. “Without criminals, there is less crime.”

这座风城不是唯一面临子弹弹幕的城市。哥伦比亚特区等地也报告了这些非法附件的问题。芝加哥是首个因这些设备提起诉讼的城市。该诉讼得益于伊利诺伊枪支产业责任法案，这项去年通过的州法律允许对枪支制造商提起因公害而诉讼，但它也依赖于联邦法律禁止冲锋枪。这项诉讼可能是首例，但可能不是最后一起。■

The Windy City is not alone in facing a barrage of bullets. The District of Columbia and others have also reported problems with these illegal add-ons. Chicago is the first city to sue over the devices. The lawsuit is made possible by the Illinois Firearms Industry Responsibility Act, a state law passed last year that allows gun manufacturers to be sued for public harm, but it also rests on a federal law prohibiting machineguns. This suit may be the first of its kind, but it probably won’t be the last. ■

监管机构正在迫使科技巨头重新思考其人工智能策略 (Regulators are forcing big tech to rethink its AI strategy)
=================================================================================

初创企业被聘用潮和紧密合作取代 (Startup acquisitions have been replaced by hiring sprees and tight partnerships)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![微软总裁布拉德·史密斯正在“新时代的新策略”主题演讲](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_WBP503.jpg)

**Trustbusters**将大科技公司纳入调查范围。3月25日，欧洲委员会展开对苹果、Alphabet（谷歌的母公司）和Meta（即Facebook）的调查。布鲁塞尔的监管机构认为，美国科技巨头们为遵守数字市场法案所采取的措施不够完善，而这项法案旨在确保欧盟科技行业的公平竞争。

Trustbusters have big tech in their sights. On March 25th the European Commission opened a probe into Apple, Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and Meta (which is Facebook’s). Regulators in Brussels think the measures which the American technology behemoths have put in place to comply with the Digital Markets Act, a sweeping new law meant to ensure fair competition in the EU’s tech industry, are not up to scratch.

几天前，美国司法部与16个州的检察长一起对苹果提起诉讼，这可能是自25年前司法部与微软对抗以来对美国科技界提起的最大胆的诉讼。起诉称，苹果利用在智能手机领域的垄断地位“扼杀”创新， “扼杀”竞争对手，并阻止用户购买竞争对手的设备。苹果否认有不当行为。

Days earlier America’s Department of Justice, along with attorneys-general from 16 states, sued Apple in what could be the most ambitious case brought against American tech since the DoJ battled Microsoft a quarter-century ago. It alleges that the iPhone-maker uses a monopoly position in smartphones to “thwart” innovation, “throttle” competitors and discourage users from buying rival devices. Apple denies wrongdoing.

这些审查看似是在向过去回溯；案件涉及科技巨头们现有的产品和商业模式。但正值它们试图从下一波技术颠覆——类似ChatGPT的“生成”人工智能（AI）中获利的时刻。这也改变了科技巨头们面对挑战的方式。

All this scrutiny is, on its face, backward-looking; the cases concern the tech giants’ existing products and business models. But it is intensifying just as they try to position themselves to profit from the next wave of technological disruption—ChatGPT-like “generative” artificial intelligence (AI). And it is changing how the titans of tech approach the challenge.

在以往的技术变革浪潮中，大公司通常收购初创企业以保持领先地位。在另一起诉讼中，美国主要的**Trustbusting**机构——联邦贸易委员会（FTC）指控Meta通过收购Instagram和WhatsApp等初创竞争对手等方式，扼杀了社交媒体领域的竞争。无论FTC是否在法庭上获胜并迫使Meta出售其中一个或两个应用程序，类似的交易在今天都不太可能在美国和欧洲的监管机构那里获得通过。

During previous waves of technological change large companies often bought upstart innovators to stay ahead. In another lawsuit the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), America’s main trustbusting agency, alleges that Meta stifled competition in social media by, among other things, buying Instagram and WhatsApp, two budding rivals. Whether or not the FTC has its way in court and forces Meta to divest one or both of the apps, any similar deal today would be a non-starter with regulators in America and Europe.

由于收购变得越来越困难，科技巨头们转而开始分阶段地对有前景的初创企业进行投资。根据研究公司PitchBook的数据，2023年，约占27亿美元中小型AI公司筹集的资金的三分之二来自Alphabet、亚马逊和微软。其中包括微软对OpenAI的100亿美元投资，OpenAI是ChatGPT和全球最热门的人工智能初创企业，以及谷歌对Anthropic的20亿美元股权投资，Anthropic是另一家聪明的“大型语言模型”创造者。巨头们正在分散这些较小的赌注：微软已经支持其他模型制造商，比如Mistral，这是一家一年历史的法国公司，致力于与OpenAI竞争。（这些初创企业也在多样化融资：除了谷歌的投资外，Anthropic可能还会从亚马逊获得多达40亿美元的资金。）

With takeovers getting thornier, the tech giants have instead taken to investing piecemeal in promising startups. In 2023 about two-thirds of the $27bn raised by smaller AI companies came from Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft, according to data from PitchBook, a research firm. That includes Microsoft’s $10bn investment in OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT and the world’s hottest AI startup, and Google’s $2bn stake in Anthropic, another creator of clever “large language models”. The giants are spreading these smaller bets: Microsoft has backed other model-makers, such as Mistral, a year-old French firm trying to give OpenAI an run for its money. (The startups are diversifying their financing, too: besides Google’s investment, Anthropic may get up to $4bn from Amazon.)

此类交易通常涉及除了成为初创企业股东名单之外的条款。它们通常使投资者独家获得较小公司的技术。微软极力强调，其对OpenAI和Mistral的投资不涉及持有股权（尽管拒绝透露确切涉及什么）。

Such deals often involve terms other than getting onto a startup’s shareholder list. They often give the investor access to the smaller company’s technology, sometimes exclusively. Microsoft is at pains to point out that its investments in OpenAI and Mistral do not involve taking equity stakes (though it declines to divulge what they do involve, exactly).

一些AI交易可能涉及巨头之间的安排。据称，苹果和Alphabet正商讨一项交易，可能导致部分iPhone功能由Google的生成式AI——Gemini提供支持。

Some AI deals may involve arrangements between the behemoths themselves. Apple and Alphabet are reportedly discussing one that could result in some iPhone features being powered by Gemini, the search giant’s generative AI.

另一种方法是挖掘顶尖的AI创业者和技术人员。自2022年初以来，Alphabet、亚马逊、苹果、Meta和微软共同从OpenAI、Anthropic和Cohere（一家加拿大模型制造商）招募了约30名AI专家，据研究公司Live Data Technologies称。3月19日，微软宣布将招募几乎全部Inflection AI的员工，这是另一家开发尖端模型的公司，其中包括其联合创始人穆斯塔法·苏莱曼。 （苏莱曼先生是*经济学人*的母公司的董事会成员。）

Another approach is to poach star AI entrepreneurs and technologists. Since the start of 2022 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft have collectively hired some 30 AI experts from OpenAI, Anthropic and Cohere, a Canadian model-maker, according to Live Data Technologies, a research firm. On March 19th Microsoft announced that it would recruit almost the entire workforce of Inflection AI, another builder of cutting-edge models, including its co-founder, Mustafa Suleyman. (Mr Suleyman sits on the board of *The Economist*’s parent company.)

**Trustbusters**对这些发展并非熟视无睹。大西洋两岸的监管机构已经开始调查一些不涉及完全收购的最近合作协议。苹果与谷歌之间传闻的Gemini交易，模仿了一项类似协议，使谷歌成为苹果设备上的默认搜索引擎——这已经成为司法部针对谷歌提起的另一起反垄断案件的核心。大科技公司在人工智能招聘方面的做法很可能很快就会引起调查。

Trustbusters are not blind to these developments. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are already probing some of the recent tie-ups that fall short of full acquisitions. Apple’s rumoured Gemini deal with Google is modelled on a similar agreement that makes Google the default search engine on Apple’s devices—and that is already at the centre of another antitrust case that the DoJ has brought against Google. It is probably only a matter of time before they start looking into big tech’s AI-hiring practices.

这些巨头们可能希望，在这些反垄断行动被提出、更不用说得到解决之前，他们已经主宰了AI市场——就像他们在今天的数字业务中所做的那样。宽恕可以以后再求，即使这意味着反复走进法庭。 ■

The giants may be hoping that by the time these antitrust actions are pursued, let alone resolved, they will have cornered the AI market—as they have done with today’s digital businesses. Forgiveness can be sought later, even if that means repeated trips to the courtroom. ■

对耐克的营销胜利是阿迪达斯的商业胜利 (A marketing victory for Nike is a business win for Adidas)
===========================================================================

体育服装巨头的竞争愈发激烈。 (The contest of the sportswear giants heats up)
-----------------------------------------------------------

![德国国家队在官方商店的球衣。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_WBP502.jpg)

**德国足球协会（DFB）选择在2027年至2034年将耐克（Nike）取代阿迪达斯作为德国足球队球衣供应商，这是一个纯粹出于商业考虑的决定。** 与此相反，德国人对这项结束了长达77年的德国品牌合作的决定做出了高度情绪化的反应。卫生部长卡尔·劳特巴赫（Karl Lauterbach）用**Heimat**这个德语词来表达，“商业正在摧毁一部分家园”，这个词唤起了家园、归属感和地方的概念。经济部长罗伯特·哈贝克（Robert Habeck）表示，他希望能看到一点更多的“本土爱国主义”。拜仁州直言不讳的州长马库斯·索德（Markus Söder）简单地称这个决定为“错误、可惜和令人费解”。

The choice to replace Adidas with Nike as the supplier of kit for the German football team from 2027 to 2034 was a purely commercial decision by the German Football Federation (DFB). Germans’ reaction to the ending of a 77-year-old all-German partnership was, by contrast, highly emotional. Commerce is destroying a piece of *Heimat*, lamented Karl Lauterbach, the health minister, using the German word that evokes the idea of home, belonging and place. Robert Habeck, the economy minister, said that he would have hoped for a bit more “local patriotism”. Markus Söder, Bavaria’s straight-shooting premier, declared it simply “wrong, a pity and incomprehensible”.

**DFB主席贝恩德·诺伊恩多夫（Bernd Neuendorfer）对这种抗议声“惊讶不已”。** 在他看来，这个决定理所当然。DFB财政陷入困境，他收到了美国公司的一份报价，远高于阿迪达斯的报价，因此他接受了这个报价。据德国媒体报道，耐克提供了1亿欧元（1.08亿美元）的款项来装备国家队，是其德国竞争对手的两倍。作为全球最大的运动服装制造商，年营业利润达到60亿美元，这对耐克而言是小钱。而对于远远落后的第二名阿迪达斯来说，2023年仅从运营中获得2.68亿欧元，要与耐克持平将让其囊中羞涩。

Bernd Neuendorfer, head of the dFB, was “aghast” at the outcry. In his view, the decision was a no-brainer. The DFB is in financial dire straits and he received an offer from the American company that was far higher than the one from Adidas, so he accepted it. According to reports in the German press, Nike offered €100m ($108m) to kit out the *Nationalmannschaft*, twice as much as its German rival. For the world’s biggest maker of sportswear, with an annual operating profit of $6bn, it is pocket change. For Adidas, the distant number two, which eked out just €268m from operations in 2023, matching Nike would have burnt a hole in its pocket.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_WBC121.png)

**在2023年初接任阿迪达斯首席执行官的约翰·古尔登（Bjorn Gulden）选择金融而非足球，尽管他之前曾是一名职业球员。** 在这位慎重的挪威人的领导下，阿迪达斯似乎终于在复苏之路上了。其股价在过去12个月上涨了约40%。虽然与耐克相比，其营业利润可能相形见绌，但这给分析师们带来了惊喜，他们原本预测会亏损。古尔登先生预计今年的营业利润将达到5亿欧元。

Bjorn Gulden, who took over as chief executive of Adidas at the start of 2023, chose finance over football—his earlier career as a professional player notwithstanding. Under the no-nonsense Norwegian’s leadership, Adidas seems to be at last on the path to recovery. Its share price has risen by around 40% over the past 12 months. Its operating profit may pale in comparison with Nike’s, but it came as a pleasant surprise to analysts, who had forecast a loss. Mr Gulden expects an operating profit of €500m this year.

**阿迪达斯的首席“经营得当”，经纪公司贝恩斯坦的阿尼莎·谢尔曼（Aneesha Sherman）总结道。** 他修复了阿迪达斯与零售商之间的关系紊乱。他将广受欧洲和美国时尚爱好者喜爱的两款经典阿迪达斯运动鞋Gazelle和Samba的生产增加了十倍。他还寻找到了一种优雅的解决办法来处置由美国说唱歌手Ye设计的Yeezy鞋款，这些鞋款的库存达到了12亿欧元，Ye与阿迪达斯终止合作后，这些鞋款正在分阶段出售，部分利润将捐赠给慈善机构。

Adidas’s chief “runs the business well”, sums up Aneesha Sherman of Bernstein, a broker. He has mended Adidas’s dysfunctional relationship with retailers. He has increased the production of Gazelle and Samba, two classic Adidas trainers popular with European and American fashionistas, ten-fold. And he has found an elegant solution to €1.2bn in unsold stock of Yeezy shoes designed by Ye, an American rapper (formerly known as Kanye West) with whom Adidas has severed ties after his offensive outbursts. The Yeezies are being sold in tranches with parts of the profit going to charities.

**而耐克则需要一次胜利。** 最近，耐克警告称，其今年的销售将受到On和Hoka两个时尚跑鞋品牌的冲击。在中国这个庞大市场中，它面临着本土竞争对手如安踏等的竞争。另一家经纪公司Telsey Advisory的克里斯蒂娜·费尔南德斯（Cristina Fernández）指出，耐克的老板约翰·多纳赫正在试图通过重新专注于运动，减少库存和改善与批发商的关系来振兴这个品牌，**在12月，他还宣布未来三年削减20亿美元的成本。** 而在2月，他表示将裁员约1600人，占耐克全球员工总数的2%。

Nike, for its part, needed a win. It recently warned that its sales will be clobbered this year by On and Hoka, two trendy running-shoe brands. In China, a huge market, it faces competition from homespun rivals such as Anta. Cristina Fernández of Telsey Advisory, another broker, notes that a renewed focus on sport is one way that Nike’s boss, John Donahoe, is trying to revive the swoosh, along with reducing inventory and improving relations with wholesalers. In December he also announced $2bn in cost cuts over the next three years. And in February he said he would eliminate around 1,600 jobs, or 2% of Nike’s worldwide workforce.

**多纳赫不会在营销领域削减。** 他在上个季度投入了10亿美元用于推广耐克品牌，比之前三个月增加了10%。据报道，作为这一活动的一部分，他愿意为德国队提供比为位列世界第二的法国队提供更多的资金。所以，与其抨击古尔登和阿迪达斯，德国人应该赞美该公司的节俭。毕竟，有什么比勤俭更符合**Heimat**的精神呢？ ■

One area where Mr Donahoe’s axe will not fall is marketing. He pumped a cool $1bn into promoting Nike’s brand in the last quarter, 10% more than in the previous three months. As part of this campaign he is reportedly willing to pay much more for kitting out the German squad, which is ranked a middling 16th in the world, than for the French team, which is second. Instead of bashing Mr Gulden and Adidas, Germans should be praising the firm’s pfennig-pinching. After all, what is more *Heimat* than thriftiness? ■

The authors, who claimed to be former partners at McKinsey, rebuked the illustrious strategy consultancy for its pursuit in recent years of “unchecked and unmanaged growth”, and chastised its leadership for, of all things, a “lack of strategic focus”. With humility typical of McKinseyites, they warned that “an organisation of genuine greatness” was at risk of being lost.

这份备忘录很快被撤下，但却是麦肯锡内部不满的最新迹象。今年一月，其总裁鲍勃·斯特恩费尔斯在未能在初轮投票中获得大多数高级合作伙伴支持而被迫参加内部竞争争夺高层职位。尽管最终获胜，这件事暗示了公司内部潜在的麻烦。

The memo, which was swiftly taken down, is but the latest murmur of discontent at McKinsey. In January Bob Sternfels, its managing partner, was forced into an internal contest for the top job after he failed to clinch support for re-election from a majority of senior partners in an initial round of voting. Although he ultimately prevailed, the saga hinted at the trouble brewing within the firm.

不久之前，咨询行业看起来坚不可摧。在新冠疫情期间，随着客户加快数字化、多样化供应链以及响应加强环境、社会和治理（ESG）认证的呼声，咨询费用飙升。行业最重要公司，包括三大战略顾问公司（贝恩公司、波士顿咨询集团和麦肯锡）、四大会计巨头（德勤、安永、毕马威和普华永道）以及埃森哲（全球最大的外包公司）的咨询收入在2021年增长了20%，随后在2022年增长了13%（见图表）。

Not long ago the consulting industry looked indestructible. Fees rocketed during the covid-19 pandemic as clients sped up efforts to digitise their businesses, diversify their supply chains and respond to growing calls to bolster their environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials. The consulting revenues of the industry’s most important firms—including the triumvirate of strategy advisers (Bain, BCG and McKinsey), the “big four” accounting giants (Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC) and Accenture (also the world’s largest outsourcer)—grew by 20% in 2021 and then 13% in 2022 (see chart).

然而，自那时以来，行业“八大巨头”的增长势头已经变得疲软，根据行业观察者肯尼迪研究报告和《经济学人》根据公司报告数据估算，在2023年降至约5%。客户面临通货膨胀和经济不确定性，已经削减了炫耀性咨询项目。并购活动的减少导致了对尽职调查和公司整合支持的需求下降。

Since then, however, growth has been soggy for the industry’s “great eight”, slowing to around 5% in 2023, according to estimates by Kennedy Research Reports, an industry-watcher, and calculations by *The Economist*, based on company filings. Clients grappling with inflation and economic uncertainty have cut back on splashy consulting projects. A dearth of mergers and acquisitions has led to a slump in demand for support with due diligence and company integrations.

这给咨询公司带来了头疼。当客户需求看似无限时，它们就像没有明天一样招募员工。自2019年以来，麦肯锡的收入增长了三分之一，但员工人数增长了一半，达到了45,000人。随着初创公司和私募股权公司的工作机会减少，更少的顾问自愿离开公司，扭转了疫情期间员工离职率激增的趋势。

That has caused a headache for the consultancies. When demand from clients looked limitless, they recruited staff as if there were no tomorrow. Revenues at McKinsey are up by a third since 2019—but headcount is up by half, to 45,000. As job opportunities at startups and private-equity firms have withered, fewer consultants have left the firms of their own accord, reversing the spike in attrition rates during the pandemic.

如今，未来到来，而且是急剧到来。贝恩和德勤已经支付一些毕业生推迟入职日期。很多公司的新进顾问抱怨工作任务太少，抑制了他们的职业前景。裁员，在咨询行业通常很少见，已经变得普遍。所有四家大型会计公司都裁减了咨询团队。去年，唯一一家上市的八大公司埃森哲表示将裁员19,000人。3月21日，公司报告称其截至2月的季度咨询收入同比下降了3%，在上一个季度持平之后。它还下调了未来一年的增长预期，导致其股价下跌了9%。

Now tomorrow is here, with a vengeance. Bain and Deloitte have paid some graduates to delay their start dates. Newbie consultants at a number of firms complain that there is too little work to go around, stunting their career prospects. Lay-offs, typically rare in consulting, have become widespread. All of the big four have made cuts to their advisory teams. Last year Accenture, the only one of the eight that is publicly listed, said it would fire 19,000 staff. On March 21st the company reported that its consulting revenues for the quarter to February shrank by 3%, year on year, after flattening in the previous quarter. It also lowered its growth forecast for the year ahead, sending its share price down by 9%.

咨询行业以前曾经历过动荡，包括互联网泡沫破裂和全球金融危机。然而，这一次的复苏将受三个因素的复杂影响。第一个是地缘政治。这些总部位于美国或欧洲的咨询巨头受益于几十年的全球化进程，在此期间它们将触角伸向全球各地。作为咨询收入最高的公司中，德勤是最大的公司，拥有150多个国家和地区的办事处。

The consulting industry has made it through choppy waters before, including the dotcom crash and the global financial crisis. Yet its recovery this time will be complicated by three things. The first is geopolitics. The consulting giants, all of which are based in America or Europe, have benefited from decades of globalisation during which they spread their tendrils into every part of the globe. Deloitte, the biggest of the bunch by consulting revenues, has offices in more than 150 countries and territories.

现在这让这些公司陷入了尴尬的境地。上个月有消息称，由麦肯锡联合创办的城市中国计划为中国政府提供建议，这些建议帮助制定了“中国制造2025”计划，旨在减少经济对外国专业知识的依赖，并将中国置于从电动汽车到人工智能等各个领域的前沿。尽管麦肯锡否认编写了该报告，但一些美国议员要求该公司被禁止参与美国政府的合同。在截至2023年9月的12个月中，联邦政府向麦肯锡支付了1亿美元以上的费用。

That is now placing the firms in awkward spots. Last month it emerged that the Urban China Initiative, a think-tank co-founded by McKinsey, provided advice to the Chinese government in 2015 that helped shape its “Made in China 2025” plan, which has sought to reduce the economy’s reliance on foreign know-how and place China at the forefront of sectors from electric vehicles to artificial intelligence (AI). Although McKinsey denied that it wrote the report, some American lawmakers have called for the firm to be barred from American government contracts. In the 12 months to September 2023 the federal government paid McKinsey more than $100m in fees.

现在中国也开始排挤各种外国顾问。去年，全球律师事务所德汇解除了与中国德商德诚的合作，因为新的网络安全和数据保护法规使得这种合作变得不可行。尽管中国尚未打造出本土的咨询巨头，但它已经开始让外国咨询公司感到生存困难。去年，贝恩上海办公室的员工被中国当局询问，原因不明。据报道，中国政府正在审查普华永道在中国破产房地产开发商恒大的审计工作。该公司被中国政府指控恒大虚假夸大其收入。这可能对普华永道在中国的咨询业务产生影响。

Now China is also starting to squeeze foreign advisers of various stripes out of its market. Last year Dentons, a global law firm, unwound its tie-up with Dacheng, a Chinese one, in response to new cyber-security and data-protection rules that made the combination unworkable. Although China is yet to produce a home-grown consulting powerhouse, it has already begun to make life difficult for foreign ones. Staff in Bain’s Shanghai office were questioned by Chinese authorities last year, for reasons unknown. On March 22nd it was reported that the Chinese government was scrutinising PwC’s auditing work at Evergrande, a bankrupt Chinese property developer that has been accused by China’s government of fraudulently inflating its revenues. That could weigh on PwC’s consulting business in the country.

对于行业复苏来说，第二个威胁是对ESG的兴趣减退，批评者称之为“醒目资本主义”。近年来，咨询巨头在构建ESG方面投入巨资，尤其是在脱碳方面。2021年，麦肯锡并购了三家可持续性咨询公司。2022年，埃森哲收购了五家。迄今为止，这些投资似乎正在取得成效。贝恩的老板克里斯托夫·施韦策表示，去年环境咨询公司Quantis是他公司工作增长最快的领域之一。

It is not only the West’s relationship with China that is causing problems. In February the bosses of BCG, McKinsey and Teneo, a smaller consultancy, along with Michael Klein, a dealmaker, were hauled before a congressional committee in Washington after failing to hand over details of their work for Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. The committee is investigating Saudi Arabia’s efforts to build “soft power” in America through, for example, its investments in sports such as golf. McKinsey and BCG said that their staff in Saudi Arabia could be imprisoned if the firms divulged what they had done for their client. The Gulf has been a rare bright spot for the consultants of late, with the oil-rich states splashing out on advice as they seek to diversify their economies.

这种增长是否会以相同的速度继续尚不清楚。包括佛罗里达、密苏里和德克萨斯等共和党管辖的州撤回了存放在全球最大资产管理公司贝莱德的资金，以抗议其在进行投资时使用ESG考量因素。另一个行业分析师Source Global Research今年一月对咨询客户进行的调查显示，可持续项目在他们的优先事项中排名第十，较2023年的第四位下降。一些咨询行业的重要人士承认，某些客户正在削减他们的气候雄心。一位高管表示，受紧缩的消费者现在无法支付绿色溢价。

Waning enthusiasm for ESG, denounced by critics as “woke capitalism”, presents a second threat to the industry’s recovery. In recent years the consulting giants have spent big on building out their ESG offerings, especially around decarbonisation. In 2021 McKinsey acquired three sustainability consultancies. In 2022 Accenture gobbled up five. So far these investments seem to be paying off. Christoph Schweizer, the boss of BCG, which acquired Quantis, an environmental consultancy, in 2022, says that sustainability was one of his firm’s fastest-growing areas of work last year.

对于“生成型”人工智能的客户兴奋也为行业的复苏带来第二个威胁。近年来，咨询巨头在发展ESG方面进行了大额投资，特别是脱碳。2021年，麦肯锡收购了三家可持续性咨询公司。2022年，埃森哲收购了五家。到目前为止，这些投资似乎是值得的。贝恩购买了环境咨询公司Quantis。BCG的老板说，脱碳是他公司去年工作增长最快的领域之一。

Whether that growth will continue at the same pace is less clear. In America Republican-run states including Florida, Missouri and Texas have withdrawn funds parked with BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, in protest over its use of ESG considerations when making investments. Consulting clients surveyed in January by Source Global Research, another industry analyst, ranked sustainability projects tenth in their list of priorities for the year, down from fourth in 2023. Some consulting grandees admit that certain clients are reining in their climate ambitions. Stretched consumers are now less able to pay a green premium, suggests one bigwig.

**巴西**公司的总裁曼尼·马塞达认为，这些机器人将为咨询顾问节省时间，让他们更好地了解客户的“组织现实”。

The third and thorniest challenge for the great eight is technological change. For many years clients sought their help to modernise creaky old systems. Increasingly, the consultants themselves are grappling with digital disruption. The boss of a big buy-out firm says that his dealmakers are turning to software tools and data providers rather than pricey consultants for some of the analysis needed to evaluate a target company. Other tasks that legions of consultants once spent hours on, such as compiling and categorising data on a company’s spending habits, can now be done at the push of a button.

这种“生成型”人工智能引起客户的兴奋也为新工作创造了机会。施韦策表示，BCG已经与客户完成了数百个围绕这项技术的项目。埃森哲在过去六个月里已经预订了价值11亿美元的生成型人工智能工作。其中大部分是与开发人员进行合作。埃森哲一直与微软合作。三月，咨询公司宣布与AI模型构建商Cohere达成合作，而麦肯锡也与之合作。贝恩与ChatGPT的制造商OpenAI达成了联盟。BCG正在与另一家AI公司Anthropic合作。

The consultants are not standing idle. Bain, for example, has redesigned the way it does due diligence on companies, incorporating nifty tools such as web-scraping programs. The firms are also racing to stay one step ahead of AI. Last August McKinsey launched Lilli, a ChatGPT-like bot trained on its corpus of frameworks and other intellectual property, which consultants can use to speed up their work. Others have followed suit. Manny Maceda, the managing partner of Bain, reckons these bots will free up time for consultants to better understand the “organisational realities” of their clients.

这些合作看起来是对咨询公司的增长的一个受欢迎的来源。然而，随着时间的推移，它们有可能变成负担，尤其是如果它们成功的话。如果企业客户迅速适应聊天机器人，他们可能会更快地直接去找硅谷制造商。如果发生这种情况，**八大**公司从人工智能获得的短期收益可能会让它们走向无关紧要。对于所有的战略精英来说，这是一个需要深思熟虑的问题。 ■

Excitement among clients over this type of “generative” AI is also creating opportunities for new work. Mr Schweizer says that BCG has already completed hundreds of projects with clients around the technology. Accenture has booked $1.1bn-worth of generative-AI work in the past six months. Much of this is happening in collaboration with the tech companies developing the AIs. Accenture has been working with Microsoft. In March the consulting firm also announced a partnership with Cohere, an AI-model builder with which McKinsey has buddied up, too. Bain has an alliance with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. BCG is collaborating with Anthropic, one more AI firm.

Such partnerships look like a welcome source of growth for the consultants. In time, though, they could become a drag—especially if they are successful. The quicker corporate clients become comfortable with chatbots, the faster they may simply go directly to their makers in Silicon Valley. If that happens, the great eight’s short-term gains from AI could lead them towards irrelevance. That is something for all the strategy brains to stew on. ■

遇见数字时代的大卫挑战谷歌的歌利亚 (Meet the digital David taking on the Google Goliath)
====================================================================

杰夫·格林将The Trade Desk打造成一个勇敢的在线广告强国。 (Jeff Green has built The Trade Desk into a plucky online-advertising powerhouse)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Glass jar with cookies, guarded by railing with a stop sign.](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_WBD000.jpg)

![一玻璃罐里装满曲奇饼干，外面有栏杆和一个停车标志。]（）

JEFF GREEN learned about marketing the hard way. In his late teens he was sent to Ventura, on the Californian coast, as a Mormon missionary. He spent 12 hours a day knocking on people’s doors, mostly to have them slammed in his face. His sales pitch was hardly compelling on the bikini-loving west coast, but as he tells Schumpeter: “If you can convince people to give up premarital sex, 10% of their income, no more alcohol, no more smoking or coffee or tea, and then go to church three hours on Sunday, then arguably you can sell anything.” Today he is head of a digital-advertising platform, The Trade Desk (TTD), which he co-founded and based in Ventura, his old stamping-ground. Its market value of $42bn is only slightly less than the combined worth of two of the most valuable ad agencies, Publicis and Omnicom. In digital advertising, the only firms bigger—albeit much, much bigger—are the Goliaths of big tech.

杰夫·格林通过艰难的方式了解了营销。在十几岁的时候，他被派往加利福尼亚海岸的文图拉，作为摩门教传教士。他每天花12个小时敲人家的门，大多数时候都是被人摔门。在这个阳光普照的西海岸，他的销售技巧并不令人信服，但是他告诉《萨帕特》：**“如果你能说服他人放弃婚前性行为、将十分之一的收入捐献、不再喝酒，戒烟和咖啡或茶，并在周日去教堂三个小时，那么可以说你可以卖任何东西。”**如今，他是数字广告平台The Trade Desk (TTD)的负责人，他是该公司的联合创始人，总部设在他的老地方文图拉。其市值420亿美元，仅略低于两家最有价值的广告公司Publicis和Omnicom的总市值。在数字广告业务中，唯一比他更大的公司是科技巨头中那些巨头们。

Mr Green is no longer a Mormon. In 2021 the billionaire publicly parted ways with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, rebuking it for its accumulated wealth and intolerant stance on issues such as gay rights. But he remains a crusader. His latest fight is against Google. Following the lead taken three years ago by Apple, maker of the iPhone, this year Google aims to phase out cookies, bits of software code that enable marketers to track consumers digitally across third-party websites and target them with ads. Google’s justification for ending the practice is data privacy. But Mr Green says that is a figleaf, and that Google’s cookie removal benefits its own full-throttled advertising platform at the expense of others. “They kept their Ferrari…and said everyone else should ride bicycles,” he says. He is on a mission to ensure the digital-ad machinery remains on four wheels.

格林先生不再信奉摩门教了。2021年，这位亿万富翁公开与末世圣徒耶稣基督教会划清界限，指责其过于富有和在同性恋权利等问题上的偏执立场。但他仍然是一位改革者。他目前的战斗对象是谷歌。仿效苹果三年前采取的做法，谷歌今年计划淘汰cookie，这是一种软件代码，使营销人员能够跨第三方网站数字追踪消费者并向他们投放广告。谷歌终止这种做法的理由是数据隐私。但格林认为这只是个幌子，谷歌取消cookie的实质利益在于其自身全力推广的广告平台，却损害了其他公司。他说：“他们保留了自己的法拉利……还说其他人应该骑自行车。” 他的使命是确保数字广告机制仍然能够正常运转。

TTD focuses on placing digital ads in auctions across parts of the internet outside the walled gardens of Google, Apple and other tech giants. That means targeting things like streaming-video content (such as Disney+ and Hulu), audio platforms (Spotify) and the news media. He calls this the “open internet”. It is a lucrative business: TTD charges advertisers a commission, or take rate, of about 20% to target digital ads at scale. But it is a lopsided industry: in round numbers, Mr Green says global ad spending is approaching $1trn. Just $10bn of that, or 1%, went through TTD last year. Google’s revenues, mostly from digital ads, were a stonking $307bn. In order to ensure that within a cookie-less internet advertisers do not simply double down on Google or its sister company, YouTube, TTD has rolled out an alternative open-source technology, known as Unified ID 2.0 (UID2), that it hopes will improve on cookies as an industry standard.

TTD专注于在谷歌、苹果和其他科技巨头的围墙花园之外的互联网部分进行广告竞拍。这意味着以流媒体视频内容（如Disney+和Hulu）、音频平台（Spotify）和新闻媒体为目标。他称这为“开放互联网”。这是一个利润丰厚的业务：TTD向广告客户收取大约20%的佣金，或者说广告投放规模。但这是一个不平衡的行业：格林先生估计，全球广告支出接近1万亿美元。去年，只有100亿美元，或1%，通过TTD。谷歌的收入主要来自数字广告，达到了3070亿美元。为确保在没有cookie的互联网上，广告商不会仅仅加大对谷歌或其姐妹公司YouTube的投入，TTD推出了一种名为Unified ID 2.0 (UID2)的替代开源技术，希望能够作为行业标准改进取代cookie。

Google has an enormous advantage. Billions of people use its services, and to do so, many sign in to its Chrome browser using email addresses or phone numbers. These identifiers help advertisers track people across Google’s sites. Some internet users resent this trade-off—but not enough to put them off googling, Gmail, Google Maps or YouTube. The challenge for rivals such as TTD is to find a way to persuade users of services outside the walled gardens to join a centralised system of anonymised identifiers so that digital advertising can flourish.

谷歌具有巨大的优势。数十亿人使用其服务，并且很多人使用电子邮件地址或电话号码登录其Chrome浏览器。这些标识符帮助广告商跟踪人们在谷歌网站上的行为。一些网络用户对这种权衡感到不满，但不足以阻止他们使用谷歌搜索、Gmail、谷歌地图或YouTube。TTD等竞争对手面临的挑战是找到一种方法说服那些超越科技巨头围墙外服务的用户加入一个集中的匿名标识符系统，以便数字广告能够蓬勃发展。

What could induce consumers to surrender their email addresses or phone numbers and invite a non-Google advertising onslaught? Mr Green says streaming platforms like Netflix and Spotify provide an answer. They offer ad-supported tiers in exchange for cheaper subscriptions, which many viewers have flocked to. The IDs used to sign in to those services promote the sort of personalisation for which advertisers pay high prices. That can mean the streamers show fewer, more targeted ads.

是什么让消费者放弃他们的电子邮件地址或电话号码，并邀请非谷歌广告入侵呢？格林先生说Netflix和Spotify等流媒体平台给出了答案。他们提供以广告支持的套餐，以换取更便宜的订阅，许多观众已经涌向这一选择。用于登录这些服务的ID促进了广告商支付高价的个性化。这可能意味着流媒体内容将显示更少、更具针对性的广告。

He hopes that as such multi-tiered mixes of subscriptions and ads become more common, consumers will consent to having their anonymised identifiers distributed across the parts of the internet outside the tech giants’ domains. This, Mr Green adds with his missionary hat back on, could offer a lifeline to struggling web publishers whose business models currently rely on those giants’ whims. He points to Meta’s recent decision to shut down Facebook News, which was a source of revenues for many content providers, as potentially hurting the economics of the news industry, thus lowering the quality of journalism and, by extension, undermining the political process.

他希望随着这种多层次的订阅和广告混合越来越常见，消费者将同意将他们的匿名标识符分发到科技巨头领域之外的互联网部分。格林先生重新戴上他的传教帽说，这可能给那些业务模式目前依赖于这些巨头决策的网络发布商提供一根救命稻草。他指出Meta最近决定关闭Facebook News，这对许多内容提供者是一项收入来源，可能会损害新闻行业的经济，从而降低新闻质量，进而破坏政治进程。

TTD has its work cut out achieving its boss’s ambitions. Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf of eMarketer, a consultancy, says the number of identifiers like UID2 has “exploded” as rivals try to cook up alternatives to cookies. She wonders if any of them will achieve the scale necessary to bypass the tech giants. The focus on Netflix-like connected-TV platforms is also a risk. The big streamers might favour direct access to advertisers over relying on a middleman like TTD, which could then find it harder to sustain its take rate. Moreover, just as the cookie upheaval is under way, an even bigger disruption of digital advertising may be on the horizon. Artificially intelligent chatbots could draw traffic away from publishers, undermining their advertising appeal.

TTD需要为其老板的抱负努力工作。咨询公司eMarketer的伊芙琳·米歇尔·沃尔夫表示，UID2等标识符的数量“激增”，因为竞争对手试图策划替代方案来取代cookie。她怀疑它们中是否有任何一个能够实现绕过科技巨头所需的规模。对像Netflix等连接电视平台的关注也是一种风险。大型的流媒体公司可能更青睐与广告商直接合作，而不愿通过一个类似于TTD的中间人合作，这可能让TTD难以维持其佣金率。此外，就在cookie混乱之际，数字广告可能会面临更大的颠覆。人工智能聊天机器人可能会吸引用户远离发布商，损害他们的广告吸引力。

Mr Green, ever the salesman, dismisses such worries. On March 20th two deals were announced that suggested media giants were buying into his vision. NBCUniversal said that for the first time advertisers would be able to bid for digital spots in the Olympic games, using TTD as the exchange. Disney announced it was expanding its real-time digital-ad exchange for Disney+ and Hulu using two partners, TTD and Google. As for chatty AIs, Mr Green notes that they, too, need to generate revenues. How will they do that? Obvious. Like the rest of the internet, they will one day be overrun with ads. ■

作为一名售货员，格林先生对此不以为然。3月20日，有两笔交易宣布，表明传媒巨头对他的愿景产生了兴趣。NBC环球公司表示，广告商首次能够通过TTD拍卖投放奥运会数字广告位。迪士尼宣布，将使用两个合作伙伴TTD和谷歌扩展其Disney+和Hulu的实时数字广告交易所。至于健谈的人工智能，格林先生指出，他们也需要创收。他们将如何做到？理所当然的。与互联网的其他部分一样，它们终有一天会充斥着广告。 ■

让会计再次性感起来 (Making accounting sexy again)
=====================================

这个行业需要脱胎换骨以吸引新人 (The profession needs a makeover to attract newcomers)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

![一名女性用电话查看股票价格。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_WBP001.jpg)

在抖音的用语中，“**accountant**（会计师）”是指性工作者的代码。如今，正统的财务会计师希望重新拥有这个称号，并使之对潜在招聘人员具有吸引力，在这个流行的短视频应用以及其他地方。美国注册会计师协会（**AICPA**），作为美国这一行业主要贸易团体，在**TikTok**上发布了充满职业技巧和年轻会计师（真正的那种）展示职业生涯的视频。目前拥有2.7万粉丝，但任务仍然艰巨。

IN TIKTOK PARLANCE, “accountant” is code for a sex worker. Now proper beancounters want to reclaim the title and make it appealing to prospective recruits, on the popular short-video app and elsewhere. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the profession’s main trade group in America, has a TikTok feed laden with career tips and young accountants (the real sort) living their best professional lives. It has 27,000 followers—and its work cut out.

根据美国劳工统计局的数据，去年美国拥有160万名会计师和审计师。这一数字较2019年的近200万有所下降。许多老手正逐渐退休——据**AICPA**称，五年前，四分之三的注册会计师正处于退休年龄或接近退休年龄。年轻人对接替他们的兴趣不足。2022年仅有65,000名学生完成了会计学位，相比2012至2018年间每年约80,000人的数量有所下降。

America had 1.6m accountants and auditors last year, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. That is down from nearly 2m in 2019. Many veterans are retiring—five years ago three in four certified accountants were at or near retirement age, according to AICPA. Too few youngsters are interested in taking their place. Only 65,000 students completed an accounting degree in 2022, down from around 80,000 a year between 2012 and 2018.

这对美国企业产生了实质性影响。汽车零部件供应商Advance Auto Parts去年明确提到“某些会计人员的离职和会计职位的流失”是推迟其季度监管申报的原因。它并非个例。根据彭博社的数据，2023年有700多家公司因潜在的财务报表错误而责备人员不足，通常是会计人员，这一数字几乎比2019年同类借口的公司数量增长了三分之一。

This is having a material impact on American business. Advance Auto Parts, a car-parts supplier, explicitly mentioned “the loss of certain accounting personnel and turnover of accounting positions” as a reason for delaying its quarterly regulatory filings last year. It was not alone. In 2023 more than 700 companies blamed a lack of personnel, typically in accounting, for potential errors in their financial statements, according to Bloomberg, nearly a third more than made similar excuses in 2019.

除非有更多人被吸引进这个行业，这些问题将会愈演愈烈。**Ashley Austin**在里士满大学教授会计，她表示，让会计作为一种职业吸引人是困难的。她承认，其他金融工作，如投资顾问或交易员，需要大学学习的时间较短，毕业后薪水更高。

Unless more people are attracted to the profession, such problems will proliferate. The rub is that making accounting appealing as a career is hard, says Ashley Austin, who teaches it to undergraduates at the University of Richmond. Other finance jobs, such as investment adviser or trader, require less time in college and pay more on graduation, she admits.

**Austin**女士试图通过将从业者描述为数据解释者而不是豆子计数员来促进这一行业。**PwC**是与巨大会计实践的“四大”专业服务公司之一，该公司正在与会计教授合作，使入门课程不那么枯燥，**PwC**美国首席招聘官**Rod Adams**表示。大多数通常在第一年课程中教授的苦活现在由计算机完成，留下有趣的创造性工作给人类。

Ms Austin tries to promote the profession by describing practitioners as interpreters of data rather than counters of beans. PwC, one of the “big four” professional-services firms with a giant accounting practice, is collaborating with accounting professors to make entry-level courses less tedious, says Rod Adams, PwC’s chief recruiter in America. It helps that a lot of the grunt work typically taught in first-year classes is now done by computers, leaving the fun creative stuff to humans.

**AICPA**也希望让这份工作更加吸引人，将会计师打造成战略贡献者，或者用**AICPA** 的**Tom Hood**的话来说，从“**CF-No**”（否决项目的首席财务官）到“**CF-Know**”。**AICPA**发起的一个宣传活动推崇自主性、远程工作、旅行、能够生活在任何地方等优点：这正是许多年轻人所称赞的。这项名为**Accounting+** 的倡议邀请匹兹堡钢人队的总经理，一支美式橄榄球队，来为会计课程背书。该倡议还赞助**TikTok** 的网红以使这个职业变得性感。但不要过于性感，至少有一个**TikToker**不得不澄清，她所代言的是实际的会计工作，而不是性交易。■

AICPA, too, wants to jazz up the job, by branding the accountant as a strategic contributor—or, in the words of Tom Hood of AICPA, from a “CF-No” (the chief financial officer who vetoes projects) to a “CF-Know”. One campaign led by AICPA touts virtues such as autonomy, remote work, travel, the ability to live anywhere: just the sort of thing that many youngsters say they relish. Accounting+, as the initiative is called, has enlisted the general manager of the Pittsburgh Steelers, an American-football team, to endorse accounting courses. It has also sponsored TikTok influencers to make the career sexy. Not too sexy, though—at least one of the TikTokers had to clarify that she was endorsing actual accounting, not the sex trade. ■

公司制服的优缺点 (The pros and cons of corporate uniforms)
===============================================

四分之一的美国劳动大军穿着制服。为什么？ (A quarter of the American workforce wears one. Why?)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

![Illustration of a man seated at a desk, wearing a hat and an apron with The Economist’s logo on it. ](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_WBD002.jpg)

如果你在办公室从事白领职业，并且本周前往那里，那么很可能没有人能从你的衣着中准确猜到你的工作内容。但与你互动的许多人却不同。送你到目的地的公交车司机、为你制作咖啡的咖啡师以及大楼入口处向你问候“早上好”的接待人员，他们和其他许多人很可能穿着某种企业制服。盖洛普去年夏天进行的一项针对美国工人的民意调查发现，尽管大多数员工穿着休闲服装——一些时尚，一些真的不怎么样——但将近四分之一的人穿着制服。

If you work in a white-collar job in an office and make your way there this week, it is unlikely that anyone will be able to guess exactly what you do from your clothes. That is not true for lots of the people you will interact with. The bus driver who gets you to your destination, the barista who makes your coffee and the people on reception who wish you “good morning” as you enter the building—they, and many others, are likely to be wearing some kind of corporate uniform. A poll of American workers conducted last summer by Gallup found that although most employees wear casual clothes—some smart, some really not—almost a quarter donned a uniform.

对于要求员工穿制服的雇主们，有几条支持制服的理由。它们有助于确保外表的专业性。它们展现了品牌身份，从维珍大西洋航空机组人员的红色外套到UPS快递员的“布朗斯”制服。它们可能具有有用的专业特征：厨师服的双排扣可防止烫伤，并可以反转以隐藏污渍。它们向顾客清晰地传递了一个信号，告诉顾客他们应该向谁提问，避免那些尴尬的“你在这里工作吗？”瞬间。

For employers who require them, there are several arguments in favour of uniforms. They help ensure a level of professionalism in appearance. They project a brand identity, from the red coats of Virgin Atlantic crew to the “Browns” uniform of UPS delivery drivers. They may have useful job-specific features: chefs’ jackets are double-breasted to protect against burns and can be reversed to hide stains. They send a clear signal to customers about whom they should approach with questions, avoiding those awkward “do you work here?” moments.

员工穿制服时，顾客会对此产生不同的评价，既有好的也有坏的。蒂尔堡大学的罗伯特·史密斯及其同事进行了一项研究，询问人们想象自己在接收披萨时遭遇糟糕服务的情形。然后他们展示了穿制服或非制服员工的照片；曾经对待他们不好的那个人被圈出。参与者更倾向于将糟糕的经历归咎于公司而不是个人或情况，当制服参与其中时。如果企业服装使每个员工看起来更代表他们的雇主，作者暗示最好不要把它给那些经验不足的员工。

Those customers draw different conclusions if staff are in uniform, for good and bad. A study by Robert Smith of Tilburg University and his colleagues asked people to imagine being on the receiving end of poor service when picking up a pizza. They were then shown pictures of uniformed or non-uniformed employees; the person who had notionally treated them badly was circled. Participants were more likely to blame the company than the individual or the circumstances for a bad experience when a uniform was involved. If corporate clothing makes each worker seem more representative of their employers, the authors suggest that it may be a good idea not to give it to inexperienced workers.

制服也会影响员工的心理。2012年，现任巴斯大学学者哈约·亚当姆和哥伦比亚商学院的亚当·加林斯基创造了“服饰认知”一词，用来描述特定服装对人们思维和感受的影响。对服饰认知的有效性提出了质疑，但亚当和加林斯基先生以及哥伦比亚商学院的卡尔·布莱恩·霍顿进行的一项新的荟萃分析得出，这种现象是真实存在的。

Uniforms can also affect the psychology of employees. In 2012 Hajo Adam, now of the University of Bath, and Adam Galinsky, now of Columbia Business School, coined the term “enclothed cognition” to describe the effect that specific clothes have on the way that people think and feel. Questions have been raised over the validity of enclothed cognition, but a new meta-analysis by Messrs Adam and Galinsky, along with Carl Blaine Horton of Columbia Business School, concludes that the phenomenon is real.

在一项研究中，布鲁塞尔自由大学的吉尼尤姆·佩克和根特大学的埃米莉·卡斯帕让参与者有选择以换取金钱给其他人施加电击；穿红十字制服的人表现出比穿普通服装更多的同情心。亚欧商学院的薛华·王及其合著者发现正装让人更可能做出健康的饮食选择。根据普罗维登斯学院的萨伊德·门多萨和南缅因大学的伊丽莎白·帕克斯-斯塔姆的一篇论文，在一个旨在测试反应时间的视频游戏模拟中，穿警服的人比穿自己的衣服的人更有可能开枪击中手无寸铁的目标。人靠衣装马靠鞍。

In one study Guillaume Pech of Université Libre de Bruxelles and Emilie Caspar of Ghent University gave participants the option to administer electric shocks to other people in return for money; those dressed up in Red Cross uniforms showed more empathy than those in normal outfits. Xuehua Wang of Asia Europe Business School and her co-authors found that formal clothes made people more likely to make healthy eating choices. According to a paper by Saaid Mendoza of Providence College and Elizabeth Parks-Stamm of University of Southern Maine, people who wore a police uniform during a video-game simulation designed to test reaction times were more likely than those in their own clothes to shoot unarmed targets. Clothes maketh the bang.

制服对工人的影响显然是不同的。赋予专业身份感的制服——比如医生的白大褂——可能比没有这种感觉的制服更具激励性。如果员工为自己的雇主感到骄傲，他们将更愿意成为企业的广告牌。一些工作服看起来很好，一些则是对涤纶的赞美：你不仅代表一个品牌，还代表火灾危险。有些制服舒适，有些不舒适，女性通常感受最糟糕。直到2023年，英国女警察才获得适合其解剖的防弹背心。

The effects that uniforms have on workers will obviously vary. A uniform that confers a sense of professional identity—a doctor’s white coat, say—is likely to be more motivating than one that does not. People will be happier to be a corporate billboard if they feel pride in their employer. Some work clothing looks good and some of it is a paean to polyester: you do not so much represent a brand as a fire hazard. Some uniforms are comfortable and some are not, with women usually getting the worst of it. Only in 2023 were female police officers in Britain issued with body armour made to suit their anatomy.

制服的明显反对意见，至少来自不穿制服的人，是它们抑制了个性和自主权。但那些不必穿正式制服的员工往往还是会朝着某种着装趋势发展。一些程序员似乎要求穿T恤。衬衫、长裤和巴塔哥尼亚背心的组合在纽约金融界被称为“中城制服”。高管们戴着类似狂热信徒的公司徽章。名人老板通过每天穿同一套服装来打造品牌。当你去上班时可能没有被要求穿制服，但可能你已经穿上了。■

The obvious objection to uniforms, at least from people who do not wear them, is that they suppress individuality and autonomy. But employees who do not have to wear a formal uniform often gravitate towards a costume anyway. Some coders seem to be under an unspoken obligation to wear T-shirts. The combination of shirt, trousers and Patagonia gilet is known as the “midtown uniform” for finance types in New York. Executives wear cultlike corporate lapel pins. Celebrity bosses build brands by wearing the same outfit day after day. You may not be required to don a uniform when you head off to work. You may nonetheless be wearing one. ■

纳伦德拉·莫迪的秘密武器：印度侨民 (Narendra Modi’s secret weapon: India’s diaspora)
================================================================

移民在国内为总理竞选助阵，同时在国外为国家游说 (Migrants help campaign for the prime minister at home and lobby for the country abroad)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪在澳大利亚悉尼的集会上讲话](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_IRP001.jpg)

本月早些时候，**北西伦敦**的一个多云早晨，一群热情的人群聚集在社区中心外，挥舞着印度国旗——还有另一面特写着莲花图案的旗帜，象征着印度执政党人民党(BJP)。有些人戴着橙色围巾，这是与印度教相关联的颜色。在社区附近举行汽车巡游之后，他们重新聚集在一座印度庙宇外。一位英国保守党议员向人群致辞，赞扬了纳伦德拉·莫迪的政府。这次集会是由人民党海外友人组织的，该组织是该党在海外的分支，受到当地媒体的少量关注。但很快，这个集会的视频出现在了许多印度媒体的网站上。

ON A GREY morning in north-west London earlier this month an enthusiastic group gathered outside a community centre to fly the Indian flag—plus another one featuring the lotus flower, symbol of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Some wore saffron scarves, a colour associated with Hinduism. After staging a car rally through the neighbourhood, they reconvened outside a Hindu temple. A British Conservative MP addressed the crowd, praising the government of Narendra Modi. The gathering, organised by the Overseas Friends of the BJP, the party’s diaspora arm, got little attention in the local media. But footage of it soon appeared on the websites of many Indian outlets.

这次集会只是印度各党海外分支举办的众多类似活动之一，因为即将于4月19日开始的印度大选已经临近。印度庞大的侨民群体正日益成为国内外动员支持的强大力量。印度政客争取这个群体是因为他们在经济和竞选上有很大影响力。与在印度本土一样，人民党比起竞争对手更加有组织且更加成功。如果莫迪先生赢得第三个任期，似乎是很可能的，他部分应该感谢侨民群体。

The rally was just one of countless such events run by the overseas branches of India’s parties, as the country’s general election that starts on April 19th beckons. India’s huge diaspora is an increasingly powerful force for mobilising support at home and abroad. Indian politicians court it for its financial and campaigning punch. As in India itself, the BJP has been more systematic and successful than its rivals. If Mr Modi wins a third term, as seems likely, he can partly thank the diaspora.

*Read more of our coverage of the [Indian election](https://www.economist.com/india-election-2024)*

海外印度人长期以来在国内政治中起着不成比例的作用，追溯到印度为独立而斗争的岁月。许多反对殖民运动的主要人物，包括贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁和莫汉达斯·甘地，在英国呆了很多年。他们作为律师接受过训练，利用吸收的思想为国内的自由辩护。一些最著名的独立后的印度总理，包括英迪拉·甘地和曼莫汉·辛格，也在国外度过了很长时间。

Indians abroad have long played a disproportionate role in politics at home, going back to India’s fight for independence. Many of the anti-colonial movement’s leading lights, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohandas Gandhi, spent years studying in Britain. Trained as lawyers, they used the ideas they had absorbed to argue for freedom back home. Some of the most notable post-independence prime ministers, including Indira Gandhi and Manmohan Singh, also spent long periods abroad.

从那时起，印度的侨民数量和影响力不断增长。根据联合国的数据，大约1800万保留印度国籍的印度人居住在国外。这使他们成为全球最大的侨民群体，其次是墨西哥人（1120万）和俄罗斯人（1080万）。根据印度政府的估计，如果算上放弃印度护照的人，这个数字可能超过3200万。

Since then, India’s diaspora has grown in size and influence. Some 18m Indians who retain their nationality live abroad, according to the UN. That makes them the largest diaspora in the world, followed well behind by Mexicans (11.2m) and Russians (10.8m). If those who have relinquished their Indian passports are included, the number may exceed 32m, according to the Indian government’s estimates.

大多数海外印度人取得了巨大的成功。根据世界银行的估计，2023年，他们汇回家乡近1250亿美元，相当于印度国内生产总值的约3.4%。在美国，80%的印度裔公民拥有大学学位。印度裔家庭的收入中位数为15万美元，是美国全国平均水平的两倍。印度裔人士领导着谷歌、世界银行和英国。

Most Indians abroad have been highly successful. In 2023 they sent home nearly $125bn in remittances, equivalent to around 3.4% of India’s GDP, according to World Bank estimates. In America 80% of citizens of Indian origin have college degrees. The median Indian household income there is $150,000, twice America’s national average. People of Indian descent lead Google, the World Bank—and Britain.

尽管在海湾国家，仍有很多低技能或半技能的印度工人从事着本地人不愿或不能从事的琐碎工作。然而，即便在那里，白领专业人士在印度人中的比例也在增长。这一比例现在接近30%。特别是在英语国家，今天的印度侨民比早期的移民拥有更多资金和影响力，后者通常从一贫如洗的境况起步。

There are still plenty of low- or semi-skilled Indian workers filling menial jobs the host countries’ natives will not or cannot do, especially in the Gulf states. Yet even there the share of white-collar professionals as a proportion of Indians is growing. It now approaches 30%. Especially in English-speaking countries, today’s Indian diaspora has more cash and clout than earlier waves of migrants, who often started out dirt-poor.

这对他们在印度政治中的角色意味着什么呢？大多数居住在印度之外的印度人并不参加印度选举投票，因为他们只能亲自在家乡的选区投票。这对他们大多数人在时间和金钱上都是成本过高。根据印度选举委员会的数据，今年的投票中仅有12万多人注册，预计只有这个数量中的一小部分会到场。

What does this mean for their role in Indian politics? Most Indians who live outside India do not vote in Indian elections, as they can vote only in person in their constituencies back home. That costs too much for most of them in time and money. Only 120,000-odd are registered for this year’s poll, according to India’s election commission, and only a fraction of that modest number are expected to turn up.

在一个拥有近10亿注册选民的国家，分散在数百个选区中的1800万潜在选票很难起到作用。此外，许多侨民印度人对莫迪的魅力仍持抵抗态度。美国的卡内基国际和平基金会于2020年对印度裔美国人进行的一项调查发现，48%的人赞成莫迪，31%反对，22%强烈反对。事实上，与在印度的印度人相比，印度人在海外对他的支持要少得多，据说在印度，78%的人支持他。一个可能的原因是他们读到比国内亲民党媒体更广泛的新闻。此外，越来越多的移民来自莫迪不那么受欢迎的南印度。

In a country with nearly 1bn registered voters, 18m potential votes dispersed across hundreds of electoral districts would be unlikely to make a difference. Besides, plenty of diaspora Indians remain immune to Mr Modi’s charms. A survey of Indian-Americans in 2020 by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an American think-tank, found that while 48% approved of Mr Modi, 31% disapproved and 22% strongly so. Indeed, the diaspora is much less enthusiastic than Indians in India, 78% of whom are said to approve of him. One reason may be that they read a wider variety of news than their relatives at home, where most media are relentlessly pro-BJP. Moreover, an increasing number of migrants are from south India, where Mr Modi is not so popular.

**至少在英国，那些近期为工作或教育而移民的人往往政治立场较为温和**，在英国经营非党派性侨民组织Bridge India的Pratik Dattani表示。对于许多侨民来说，印度政治可能并不是他们最关心的问题，排在工作、教育和日常生活之后。

At least in Britain, those who have recently migrated for work or education tend to be less politically strident, says Pratik Dattani, who runs Bridge India, a non-partisan diaspora outfit in Britain. For many in the diaspora, Indian politics may not be their main concern, ranking behind worries about jobs, education and daily life.

侨民在政治上的真正影响主要在于资金、竞选活动和传播印度的影响力。随着海外印度人在其所在国家的社会中扮演更重要的角色，许多人开始更加关注他们新国家和祖国的政治。因此，印度和外国政党都更加热切地争取他们。

The real impact of the diaspora in politics is in funding, campaigning and spreading India’s influence. As overseas Indians have become more prominent in their host societies, many have begun to take more of an interest in politics both in their new countries and back home. So political parties, Indian and foreign, are wooing them more keenly.

莫迪及其人民党对此了如指掌。他们在2014年的选举宣言中称侨民为“表达全球国家利益和事务的巨大水库”，将其“用于加强印度品牌”。第二年，该党的总书记表示，人民党视侨民为印度在海外的声音，“就像犹太社区在美国代表以色列利益一样”。

Mr Modi and his BJP are acutely aware of this. Their election manifesto in 2014 called the diaspora “a vast reservoir to articulate the national interests and affairs globally” that would be “harnessed for strengthening Brand India”. The next year the party’s general secretary said the BJP saw the diaspora as India’s voice abroad, “the way the Jewish community looks out for Israel’s interests in the United States”.

许多海外印度人已经应对起这一任务。美国的人民党海外友人计划派遣3000名印度裔美国活动人士回到印度张贴海报并拉票。他们表示将给印度境内的250万人打电话，说服他们投票支持莫迪。代表反对派国大党的印度海外国会也有类似计划，尽管其组织者对人数模糊不清。印度不透明的选举资金制度使得要准确估计侨民的捐款金额非常困难；政党很少被要求揭示捐款来源。但这必然是一个庞大数字。

Many Indians abroad have risen to the task. The Overseas Friends of the BJP in America plans to send 3,000 Indian-American activists back to India to put up posters and canvass voters. They say they will make 2.5m calls to people in India to persuade them to vote for Mr Modi. The Indian Overseas Congress, the equivalent outfit representing the opposition Congress party, has similar plans, though its organisers are vague about numbers. India’s opaque electoral-finance system makes it tricky to gauge exactly how much money the diaspora contributes; parties are rarely required to disclose the source of donations. But it is bound to be a lot.

侨民团体长期以来将政治与支持特定社群的活动相结合。但自从莫迪上任以来，这些团体变得更具政治性并且更支持印度人民党。为孩子们举办的玩耍活动或社区祈祷会更有可能带有一丝橙色的色彩。成员们在英国游说议员或在美国游说国会议员支持莫迪。

Diaspora groups have long mixed politics with support for particular communities. But they have become more political and pro-BJP since Mr Modi took over. Play-dates for children or community prayer meetings are likelier to have a saffron tint. Members lobby MPs in Britain or members of Congress in America to back Mr Modi.

然而，大多数侨民的动员活动发生在他们所在国家政治之外。许多信息传递是在社交媒体上进行的，通常是在WhatsApp群组中。成员们为莫迪最新的基础设施建设或外交成功欢呼。他们还宣传印度人民党的更黑暗的观念，比如所谓的“爱情圣战”阴谋论，称穆斯林男子系统地诱导印度教女性以便使其皈依。

Yet most mobilisation of the diaspora happens away from the host countries’ politics. Much of the messaging is on social media, usually in WhatsApp groups. Members hail Mr Modi’s latest infrastructure drive or foreign-policy success. They also promote the BJP’s darker notions, such as “love jihad”, a conspiracy theory that Muslim men are systematically seducing Hindu women in order to convert them.

政府成功争取侨民之一的原因是，人民党在国外的活动与其在国内的选举机器一样高效。外国之行中，内阁部长们一直在重点会见侨民团体，往往是为了筹集资金。在英国有数百个与印度人民党密切相关的团体活跃。这种侨民动员在美国也有所增加。

One reason for the government’s success in courting the diaspora is that the BJP’s activities abroad are as efficient as its electoral machine at home. Cabinet ministers on foreign trips make a point of meeting diaspora groups, often to raise cash. Hundreds of groups close to the BJP are active in Britain. Such diaspora mobilisation has also picked up in America.

![印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪在2019年休斯敦的震撼莫迪活动上的支持者](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_IRP002.jpg)

莫迪当选后不久，在纽约麦迪逊广场花园，面向1.8万名粉丝举行了一场集会。此前，由于据称在2002年在其家乡古吉拉特邦发生的致命暴力事件，他曾被美国拒绝入境（所有指控均被驳回）。他前往许多印度人居多的国家的行程中都会包括此类活动，最近在阿布扎比也是如此。去年，他在悉尼的侨民集会上引起了轰动。

Soon after his election Mr Modi starred at a rally for 18,000 fans in New York’s Madison Square Garden. He had previously been barred from America for his alleged part in deadly communal violence in his home state of Gujarat in 2002 (he was cleared of all charges). Many of his trips to countries with many Indians include such events, most recently in Abu Dhabi. Last year he wowed a diaspora crowd in Sydney (pictured).

北伦比亚大学的爱德华·安德森在最近撰写的一本关于侨民中印度教民族主义的书中表示，这种活动有两个目的。它们有助于将他与一个他认为在社会、文化和经济方面都非常重要的群体联系起来。以及海外人群欢呼的照片将他在国内作为受尊崇的政治家的形象展现给国内民众。

These events serve two purposes, says Edward Anderson of Northumbria University, author of a recent book on Hindu nationalism in the diaspora. They help tie him to a group he values for its social, cultural and economic weight. And the pictures of crowds cheering him abroad shine his image back home as a feted statesman.

莫迪对印度正在崛起的全球形象的强调引起了许多海外印度人的共鸣。达塔尼说：“有一种感觉，印度现在到处都有，而是这位家伙把它搞定了。”在阿布扎比，莫迪还为一座大型印度寺庙开幕，他在那里也受到了他的粉丝们的热情欢迎。“在他执政的过去十年里，印度发生了很大变化。”62岁的销售主管加尼施·萨尔马说。“他只为国家工作，而不是为自己工作，我们与世界几乎所有其他国家的关系现在都很好。”.

Mr Modi’s emphasis on India’s rising global stature resonates with many overseas Indians, says Mr Dattani. “There is a sense that India is now everywhere and this guy did it,” he says. In Abu Dhabi, where Mr Modi also inaugurated a huge Hindu temple, he was feverishly acclaimed by his fans. “For the past ten years under his rule India has really evolved,” says Ganesh Sarma, a sales executive aged 62. “He works only for the country, not for himself, and our relationship with almost the entire rest of the world is fabulous now.”

相比之下，国大党的努力却徒劳无功。该党的领导人拉胡尔·甘地也周游世界游说侨民。他的主要关注点是突显社会问题和莫迪日益专制的手段。达塔尼说，这激发了侨民中长期的批评者，但却让大多数海外印度人对他们希望看到国家形象更为正面的观点感到失望。在2023年皮尤（一家民调机构）的调查中发现，美国的印度人，无论是公民还是移民，对自己的国家有着压倒性的好感。人民党利用甘地的海外访问将他描绘为向外国人贬低自己国家的不忠诚之人。

Efforts by Congress, by contrast, have fallen flat. Rahul Gandhi, the party’s figurehead, also travels the world to lobby the diaspora. His main concern has been to highlight social problems and Mr Modi’s increasingly authoritarian methods. That resonates with long-standing critics in the diaspora, but turns off most Indians abroad who want to think well of their country, says Mr Dattani. In 2023 Pew, a pollster, found that Indians in America, both citizens and migrants, had overwhelmingly favourable views of their home country. The BJP has used Mr Gandhi’s foreign visits to paint him as disloyal for talking down his country to foreigners.

政府还瞄准了较不显著的印度人，主要是对人民党持敌对态度的学者和新闻从业者。许多人都持有一种特殊身份，称为“印度海外公民”，该身份向已放弃印度国籍的人以及与印度公民结婚的外国人提供权利（比如居住和工作在印度的权利）。人民党利用这一身份将其认定为不忠。

The government has also targeted less prominent Indians, chiefly academics and journalists hostile to the BJP. Many hold a special status called “Overseas Citizen of India” that grants rights (such as the ability to live and work in India) to people who have dropped their Indian citizenship and to foreigners married to Indian citizens. (India does not allow dual citizenship.) The BJP weaponises this status by revoking it for those it deems unpatriotic.

总之，莫迪及其人民党在国内外处理他们的对手都非常熟练。而印度日益增长的侨民群体也渴望在这一似乎势不可挡的轮船上乘风破浪。 ■

In any event, Mr Modi and his BJP are adept, at home and abroad, at dealing with their foes. And much of India’s burgeoning diaspora is keen to ride along on a seemingly unstoppable bandwagon. ■

中国银行存在不良贷款问题 (China’s banks have a bad-debt problem)
=================================================

正变得愈发明显 (As is becoming increasingly obvious)
------------------------------------------

![一名男子在中国上海陆家嘴金融区的建筑物前的外滩放风筝](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_FNP001.jpg)

来自中国南方一个小河城市的中档银行——九江银行，于3月19日发布了一则坏消息。罕见地，该银行告诉投资者，由于贷款表现不佳，2023年的利润可能会下降30%。这种信息通常是中国银行不愿透露的。事实上，它们通常会竭尽全力避免这样做。

Bank of Jiujiang, a mid-tier lender from a southern Chinese river town, imparted some bad news on March 19th. In a rare disclosure, it told investors profits for 2023 might fall by 30%, because of poorly performing loans. This is just the sort of information Chinese banks are normally reluctant to reveal. Indeed, they often go to great lengths to avoid doing so.

通常，欺骗行为如下：银行向资产管理公司（AMC）发放贷款，而后者则购买其不良贷款。双方订立的合同包括条款，使得资产管理公司能够规避其所购买的坏贷款的信用风险。保密条款使得这些安排不会被披露，有时甚至连法庭也不知情。

Typically, the subterfuge works as follows: the bank lends to an asset-management company (AMC) that in return purchases its toxic loans. The contracts drawn up between the two parties include stipulations that enable the AMC to avoid the credit risks of the bad loans they are buying. Confidentiality clauses keep these arrangements from being disclosed, sometimes even to courts.

对监管机构而言，参与这类交易的银行似乎正在解决其不良贷款问题；实际上，他们是在掩盖这些问题。根据新加坡国立大学商学院的Ben Charoenwong和Ruan Tianyue，以及中国人民大学的Meng Miao指出，随着时间的推移，这些困扰银行的贷款会不断积累。对于全国数百家银行而言，它们代表着一颗定时炸弹。

To regulators it may seem as if banks involved in such transactions are solving their bad-debt problems; in reality, they are concealing them. As Ben Charoenwong and Ruan Tianyue of the National University of Singapore Business School, and Meng Miao of Renmin University, have noted, over time these troubled loans accumulate. For hundreds of banks across the country, they represent a ticking bomb.

当局现在开始注意到这一点了。他们对金融机构以不当方式处理债务处以一连串的处罚。全国金融监管管理委员会（NAFR），一个新的银行监管机构，已经下发了20多项处罚。去年12月，商业银行中信银行因管理不善的不良债务被罚款2.2亿元人民币（3000万美元），这是创纪录的金额。中国农业银行，一个大型国有银行，因类似违规行为被罚款2700万元人民币。

The authorities are now catching on. They have hit financial institutions with a flurry of penalties for improper handling of debts. The National Administration of Financial Regulation (NAFR), a new banking regulator, has handed out more than 20 punishments. In December Citic Bank, a commercial lender, was fined 220m yuan ($30m) for mismanaging bad debt, a record amount. Agricultural Bank of China, a large state lender, received a 27m yuan fine for similar transgressions.

加强监管部分归功于这个新监管机构的更加警惕。成立于去年的NAFR比以往的机构有着更强的执行能力。银行监管曾经分散在多个机构之间，容易导致腐败，并产生监管疏漏，这促成了2019年以来数家银行的倒闭。NAFR现在似乎更加认真地对待掩盖不良贷款问题。

Increased surveillance can in part be attributed to the new watchdog’s increased vigilance. Established last year, the NAFR has stronger enforcement capabilities than its predecessors. Supervision of banks had been divided among several agencies, allowing corruption and producing lapses in oversight, which contributed to the collapse of several banks, starting in 2019. The NAFR now seems to be taking the concealment of bad debts more seriously.

但其中一些进展较早开始。十年前，银行并未将问题的真实规模披露出来，而是将其归类于其他资产类别，向监管机构暗示借款人仍有很大可能偿还债务（实际上，许多公司已经破产）。2017年，NAFR的前身之一开始督促贷款人更加真实。结果导致不良贷款大量暴露。例如，九江银行的不良贷款在2015年至去年年底之间增加了七倍。

But some of the progress began earlier. A decade ago, instead of declaring the true size of their problems by identifying debts as “non-performing loans”, banks shoved them into other categories of assets, signalling to regulators that there remained a good chance borrowers would repay (in fact, many of the companies had gone bankrupt). In 2017 one of the NAFR’s predecessors began leaning on lenders to be more truthful. The result has been an outpouring of undesirable loans. Bank of Jiujiang’s bad loans, for instance, increased seven-fold between 2015 and late last year.

这种活动激增有多少是可信的呢？识别和消化不良债务是困难的。发现这类贷款会削弱金融机构的资产负债表，因为它们被迫动用资本为未来的不良贷款提供准备金，这反过来使得政府更难将财政支持引导到追求其他政策目标的受欢迎产业。有些揭示将会合法进行，因为地方政府将为银行进行资本重组，注入资金以使它们能够继续清理不良贷款。

How much of this surge in activity can be trusted? Recognising and digesting bad debts is difficult. Discovering such lending weakens financial institutions’ balance-sheets since they are forced to use capital to provision for future bad debts, which in turn makes it harder for the government to direct financial support to favoured industries in pursuit of other policy goals. Some revelations will happen legitimately as local governments recapitalise banks, pumping in funds to enable them to continue to write off bad debts.

另一些则通过资产管理公司进行，因此有时合法性参差不齐。几十年前，中国建立了四家中央控制的资产管理公司来清理不良贷款。它们目前面临困境。其中一家在2021年需要60.6亿美元的紧急援助。其他机构资本状况不佳，导致它们购买的不良贷款越来越少，尽管银行会不断生成更多不良贷款。2016年，这四家国有资产管理公司购买了将近1万亿元人民币的总额大约1.5万亿元人民币的不良贷款。到2022年，尽管不良贷款总额增至近3万亿元人民币，但它们的购买金额已降至不到5000亿元人民币。

Others will happen via AMCs, and thus will only sometimes be legitimate. China created four centrally controlled AMCs decades ago to hoover up bad debts. They are now struggling. One needed a $6.6bn bail-out in 2021. Others are poorly capitalised and as a result buying fewer and fewer bad debts, even as banks crank out more. In 2016 the four state AMCs bought nearly 1trn yuan of about 1.5trn yuan in total non-performing loans. By 2022 their purchases came to less than 500bn yuan, despite bad debts rising to almost 3trn yuan.

今年1月下旬，官方媒体报道称，其中三家将与中国的主权财富基金合并。它们也已成为陷入困境的金融机构，几乎无法完成它们被创建时的债务清理工作。这对九江银行来说是个坏消息。对于其他数百家类似的银行也是如此。■

In late January state media reported that three of them would be merged with China’s sovereign wealth fund. They have become distressed financial institutions in their own right and can hardly perform the debt clean-up work for which they were created. That is bad news for Bank of Jiujiang. It is also bad news for hundreds of other similar lenders. ■

哪个国家将最后摆脱通货膨胀？ (Which country will be last to escape inflation?)
=============================================================

全球斗争的新分界线 (A new dividing line in the global fight)
------------------------------------------------

![An employee restocking potato chips at a grocery store in Toronto](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_FNP502.jpg)

在加拿大多伦多一家杂货店，一名员工正在重新摆放土豆片。

In January prices across the rich world rose by 5.7% year on year, down from a peak in late 2022 of 10.7%. This conceals wide variation, however. Some countries have slain the inflation beast. Others are still in the fight of their lives.

一月，富裕国家的物价同比上涨5.7%，较2022年底的10.7%高峰有所降低。然而，这其中存在着很大的差异。一些国家已经成功控制了通货膨胀。而另一些国家仍在为此努力奋斗。

To get a view of the various battlefields, we have updated our measure of “inflation entrenchment” for ten rich countries. The measure comprises five indicators: core inflation, unit labour costs, “inflation dispersion”, inflation expectations and Google-search behaviour. We rank each country on each indicator, then combine the rankings in order to form an overall score.

为了了解不同国家的情况，我们更新了对十个富裕国家进行的“**通货膨胀根深蒂固**”测量。这一测量包含五个指标：核心通货膨胀率、单位劳动成本、“通货膨胀分散度”、通货膨胀预期和谷歌搜索行为。我们对每个指标给予排名，然后将这些排名结合起来形成总体得分。

The results are better than in November, when we last conducted the exercise. They also reveal a linguistic divide. Countries in the eu and Asia perform well; in the English-speaking world, inflation is taking longer to fade. Australia tops the ranking. Britain and Canada are not far behind. America is doing better, but even there inflation remains entrenched.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_FNC980.png)

与去年十一月的结果相比，这一结果更为乐观。同时也揭示了一种语言上的分歧。欧盟和亚洲的国家表现不错；而英语国家仍需要更长时间才能缓解通货膨胀。澳大利亚在排名中名列前茅。英国和加拿大紧随其后。美国表现更好，但即便如此，通货膨胀仍较为顽固。

A few factors may explain the differences. One is fiscal stimulus during covid-19, which was 40% larger in the Anglosphere than elsewhere. The boost to demand is still visible in “core” inflation data, which strips out items such as energy, and indicates underlying inflationary pressure. British core inflation is close to 5%.

一些因素或许可以解释这种差异。一个因素是疫情期间的财政刺激措施，英语国家比其他地区多出40%。这种需求提振如今仍在“核心”通货膨胀数据中有所体现，该数据剔除了能源等项目，显示了潜在的通货膨胀压力。英国的核心通货膨胀率接近5%。

Our measure of “inflation dispersion” provides similar clues. This measures the share of consumer prices that are rising by more than 2% year on year. Australia tops the rankings here. By contrast, most Japanese prices are rising by less than 2%.

我们的“通货膨胀分散度”测量提供了类似的线索。这一指标衡量了通胀率超过2%的消费品所占的比例。澳大利亚在这一方面位居榜首。相比之下，大部分日本商品的价格增长幅度不到2%。

Immigration could also help explain the divide. The rich world has experienced an immigration boom, with a large share of the new arrivals going to English-speaking countries. Last year Australia, Britain and Canada broke net-migration records.

移民也可能有助于解释这种差异。富裕世界经历了一场移民潮，新移民的大部分流向了英语国家。去年，澳大利亚、英国和加拿大均刷新了净移民记录。

The large rise in population has supported demand. In the past year the cost of renting a flat in the Anglosphere has risen by 8%, compared with 5% elsewhere. The effects on labour markets are less clear. America’s unit labour costs, which measure how much firms pay workers to produce a unit of output, are not rising. But Canada’s are growing strongly.

人口数量的大幅增长支撑了需求。过去一年，英语国家租房成本上涨了8%，而其他地区上涨了5%。对劳动力市场的影响则不那么明显。美国的单位劳动成本并未上升。但加拿大的增长强劲。

History may also play a role in explaining the Anglosphere’s entrenched inflation. During the 2010s southern Europe and much of rich Asia saw few price rises. Inflation in the Anglosphere was firmer. Owing to these different experiences, people’s current beliefs about future inflation may also differ.

历史也可能在解释英语国家通货膨胀根深蒂固方面起到一定作用。在2010年代，南欧和大部分富裕亚洲地区几乎没有出现通货膨胀。然而，英语国家的通货膨胀率相对较高。由于这些不同的经历，人们对未来通货膨胀的看法也可能有所不同。

Data coming out of America are worrying. The public believes prices will rise by 5.3% over the next 12 months, more than in any other country in our ranking. Americans also often search on Google for inflation-related topics, suggesting that the cost of living is still on their minds. Across the Anglosphere the threat of continued high inflation—or even a second wave of price rises—has not gone away. ■

美国的数据令人担忧。公众认为未来12个月物价将上涨5.3%，这比我们排名中其他任何国家都要高。美国人在谷歌上经常搜索与通货膨胀相关的话题，这表明生活成本仍然令人忧虑。整个英语国家范围内，高通货膨胀持续存在的威胁，甚至可能出现第二波价格上涨的情况，仍未消失。■

印度如何成为亚洲之虎 (How India could become an Asian tiger)
===============================================

世界上最严格的官僚体系正在艰难实现 (The world’s most selective bureaucracy is struggling to make it happen)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![插图，印度国旗，一个工人正在推走其车轮](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_FND000.jpg)

**印度是否正实现其潜力？** 2023年第三季度，该国经济以惊人的8.4%的增长速度增长。在接下来的五年里，预计年增长率将达到6.5%，这将使其成为全球增长最快的大经济体。到目前为止，一切看起来不错。正如批评者指出的问题是，中国、日本和韩国在快速增长期间年增长率在10%左右。印度表现较差的部分原因之一是全球化放缓。但是加利福尼亚大学圣迭戈分校的卡迪克·穆拉里德哈兰(Karthik Muralidharan)的新书《加速印度的发展》提出，更快发展的关键障碍是**国家能力**的不足。

Is India achieving its potential? In the year to the third quarter of 2023, the country grew at a blistering rate of 8.4%. Over the next half-decade it is expected to expand at 6.5% a year, which would make it the world’s fastest-growing big economy. So far, so good. The problem, as critics point out, is that China, Japan and South Korea all expanded at 10% or so a year during their periods of rapid growth. Part of the reason for India’s less impressive figures is a slowdown in globalisation. But a new book by Karthik Muralidharan of the University of California, San Diego, called “Accelerating India’s Development”, argues that the crucial barrier to faster development is a lack of “state capacity”.

穆拉里德哈兰先生将这一概念描述为**政府的效力**。给予缺乏能力的国家资金就像在一个即将故障的汽车旁加油一样：它不会让你走得很远。目前，印度国家在**“使命模式”**时取得成功，实现明确定义的目标。四月份，印度将举行历史上规模最大的民主选举，选民将选出一位总理。同时，印度在教育和卫生等日常管理方面面临困难。五分之三的农村儿童在第五年级时无法以二年级水平阅读——在过去五年中，不及格率只增不减。

Mr Muralidharan describes this concept as the “effectiveness” of government. Throwing money at a state lacking capacity is like adding fuel to a car near a breakdown: it won’t get you very far. Currently, the Indian state succeeds when on “mission mode”, achieving clearly defined goals. In April it should pull off the largest democratic exercise in history, as voters pick a prime minister. At the same time, it struggles with mundane, everyday aspects of governance, such as education and health. Three in five rural children in the fifth year of school cannot read at a second-year level—and in the past five years the failure rate has only worsened.

问题的一部分在于印度民主制度的早熟。1950年，当该国大部分地区贫穷时，投票权变得普遍。公民要求国家在其没有足够资金或能力的情况下满足其基本需求。例如，印度在上世纪六十年代就启动了粮食安全计划，当时印度人均收入只有美国上世纪三十年代启动其粮食安全计划时的十五分之一。这奠定了一个模式：印度国家做了很多事情，但没有做好。

Part of the issue is the precociousness of Indian democracy. The franchise became universal in 1950, when the country was mostly impoverished. Citizens demanded that the state met their basic needs well before it had the money or capacity to do so. India launched its food-security programme in the 1960s, for instance, when it was a fifteenth as rich per person as America was when it launched its own such programme in the 1930s. This set a pattern: the Indian state does a lot, but little well.

在他的800页著作中，穆拉里德哈兰提出了一些解决方案。这本书充满着关于印度体系运作及如何改进的细节。其中三个想法脱颖而出。它们涉及国家应如何管理人员、使用技术以及改进其联邦制度。这为其他政府提供了启示。

In his 800-page tome, Mr Muralidharan lays out fixes. The book is crammed with details about how the Indian system works and could be improved. Three ideas stand out. They concern how the state should manage people, use technology and improve its federal system. And they hold lessons for other governments.

从2002年开始，穆拉里德哈兰就开始进行关于教师**缺席率**的调查。事实证明，教师甚至比学生更经常缺课：他们的缺勤率达到20-30%。问题不在于薪水。2017年耶鲁大学的罗希尼·潘德(Rohini Pande)进行的一项研究发现，在33个国家中，印度向公共部门员工提供了第二高的薪酬溢价。问题似乎在于**治理**。学校**监管**职位的**空缺率**极高，达20-40%。穆拉里德哈兰计算得出，填补这些职位的成本效益将是雇佣更多教师的十倍。

Since 2002, when Mr Muralidharan was a graduate student, he has been conducting surveys on absentee rates. It turns out that teachers skip school perhaps as often as pupils: they are absent 20-30% of the time. The problem is not pay. In 2017 a study by Rohini Pande of Yale University found that across 33 countries, India offered the second-highest wage premium to public-sector employees. Rather, the problem appears to be governance. School supervisory positions have ultra-high vacancy rates of 20-40%. Mr Muralidharan calculates that filling such roles would be ten times more cost-effective than hiring more teachers.

这些问题**反映**出对公务管理的一种奇怪的方法。每年大约有100万印度人申请大约1000个空缺，这使其成为历史上最具选择性的官僚体系之一。然而，印度每1000人只有16名公共雇员，是世界上最低的比例之一。印度官员还会在各级政府的不同职位之间不断轮换，平均每15个月就会换一次。正如一位最近退休的官员所言，这意味着他们没有足够的时间在任何一个领域发展适当的专业知识。因此，问题得不到解决。

Such problems reflect a strange approach to civil-service management. About 1m Indians apply each year for about 1,000 slots, making it one of the most selective bureaucracies in history. Yet India has just 16 public employees per 1,000 people, one of the lowest ratios in the world. Indian officials also hop from position to position across various different tiers of government, moving every 15 months on average. As a recent retiree notes, this means that they have far too little time to develop proper expertise in any one area. Therefore problems go unresolved.

更好的数据将有所帮助。不应该需要一项学术调查才能确定教师缺席率。官方数据显示的教育成果比独立组织收集的数据要乐观得多。学校和低级官僚有动机作弊。因此，穆拉里德哈兰建议采用数字数据收集、审计和更严格的问责制。

Better data would help. It should not take an academic survey to ascertain rates of teacher absenteeism. Official numbers on educational outcomes paint a far rosier picture than those collected by independent organisations. Schools and low-level bureaucrats have incentives to cheat. As such, Mr Muralidharan suggests digital data collection, audits and stiffer accountability.

该书中贯穿始终的一个主题是要关注**印度的联邦结构**。该国有28个极度多样化的邦，其中15个邦人口规模大到足以排在世界人口前五分之一。在历史上，印度政治家易受腐败循环的影响，即公司贿赂领导人以换取好处，领导人然后使用这些资金资助昂贵的竞选活动，实际上就是贿赂选民。在一些邦，这种循环开始出现问题。承诺解决问题的竞选活动正是使印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪蜚声全球的原因。

A running theme throughout the book is the need to pay attention to India’s federal structure. The country has 28 hugely diverse states, 15 of which are big enough to be in the top fifth of the world’s countries by population. Historically, Indian politicians have fallen prey to cycles of corruption in which companies bribe leaders in exchange for favours, with leaders then using the money to fund expensive campaigns that involve, in effect, bribing voters. In some states, this cycle is starting to break down. Campaigns promising to get stuff done are precisely what propelled Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, to fame when he ran the state of Gujarat.

然而，印度“第三层”政府，由村庄、城镇和城市组成，进展不够令人满意。中国领导人邓小平（1978年至1989年任职）提出的改革奖励地方官员的经济表现。印度可以采取类似的做法，尤其是各邦赋予本地政府更多资源和权力。在穆拉里德哈兰调查的18个类似国家中，印度在财政事务上的分权结构最为弱化。只有3%的州支出发生在地方层面，而中国是51%。2000年，印度的三个邦——比哈尔、中央邦和北方邦——被分成两个地区。2014年，安得拉邦也是如此。所有四次分裂都导致经济增长加快。

Progress in the “third tier” of government, which is made up of villages, towns and cities, has been less impressive, however. Deng Xiaoping, China’s leader from 1978 to 1989, introduced reforms that rewarded local officials for their economic performance. India could use something similar, especially if states granted their local authorities more resources and power. Of the 18 similar countries looked at by Mr Muralidharan, India was the least decentralised when it came to fiscal affairs. Just 3% of state spending happens at a local level, compared with 51% in China. In 2000 three Indian states—Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh—were split in two. So was Andhra Pradesh in 2014. All four splits have led to faster economic growth.

穆拉里德哈兰的书中还有许多其他内容。但是人员、数据和联邦制度的变革将共同构成一揽子改革措施，这将对印度的**治理**和因此经济增长产生奇迹。事实上，印度各城市和邦之间的表现差异巨大说明了潜在利益。卡纳塔克邦，一个规模大且管理良好的邦，人均收入比印度最贫困的邦—比哈尔邦高出六倍，这使得印度成为全球地域不平等最严重的国家之一。内部移民相对较少，这意味着为了加速收入增长，贫困邦将不得不整顿自己。穆拉里德哈兰提出的变革将很难实施，但并非不可能。如果一些邦迈出这一步，可能会激励其他邦效仿。 ■

There is much else in Mr Muralidharan’s book. But changes to personnel, data and federalism would together represent the beginnings of a reform package that could do wonders for India’s governance, and therefore its growth. Indeed, the sheer variation in performance across India’s cities and states demonstrates the potential benefits. Karnataka, a large and reasonably well-run state, is six times richer per person than Bihar, the country’s poorest state—making India one of the world’s most geographically unequal countries. Internal migration is relatively rare, which means that for incomes to grow faster, poor states will have to get their act together. The changes outlined by Mr Muralidharan will be tough to enact, but not impossible. And if some states make the leap, they may inspire others to follow their example. ■

该国股票价格极其昂贵 (The country’s stocks are extremely expensive)
------------------------------------------------------

![插图：一头有星条旗迸发出的公牛](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_FND001.jpg)

每周都在创新高。难怪市场上正在逐渐产生一种不安感。根据美国银行最新的月度调查，全球大约40%的基金经理认为，**人工智能（AI）**股票——这是这轮繁荣的关键推动力——已经处于泡沫之中。即使是**华尔街**上最憧憬的预测人员们也认为，美国的标普500指数在剩下的九个月里只能取得微弱的增长。对于一些人来说，这种紧张意味着可能会发生崩盘。但对每个人来说，这也带来了一个问题：鉴于股价已经上涨如此之多，还有哪些股票具有很好的价值？

EVERY WEEK, a new high. Little wonder a sense of unease is settling over markets. Some 40% of global fund managers think that artificial-intelligence (AI) stocks—a crucial driver of the rally—are already in a bubble, according to Bank of America’s latest monthly survey. Even Wall Street’s most starry-eyed pundits reckon America’s S&P 500 index of leading shares can eke out only minor gains in the remaining nine months of the year. For some, such nervousness portends a crash. But for everyone, it prompts a question: with stock prices having already risen so much, are there any left that offer good value?

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_FNC030.png)

“**价值**”股票并不时髦，而且理由充足。它们被定义为价格低于基础资产或收益的股票（与“成长”股票相对，后者在这些指标上价格高昂，但承诺利润迅速增长）。如果这听起来很吸引人，那么近年的回报并不如人意。过去十年，**价值**股票的表现不如整个市场，并且被成长股对手甩得很远（参见图表1）。在2022年，随着利率上升和投机性资产价格下跌，这种振荡似乎短暂地出现。但仅仅是短暂地：当前的**牛市**再次导致**价值**股票被其他股票击败。

“Value” stocks are unfashionable, and with good reason. They are defined as shares with prices that are low compared with their underlying assets or earnings (as opposed to “growth” stocks with prices that are high on these measures, yet which promise rapidly rising profits). If that sounds appealing, the returns of recent years have not been. Over the past decade value stocks have performed worse than the broader market and been left in the dust by their growth counterparts (see chart 1). In 2022, as interest rates rose and the prices of speculative assets fell, the pendulum briefly seemed to swing back. But only briefly: the current bull market has again seen value stocks trounced by the rest.

这一连串的失败导致许多人宣布**价值**投资已死。批评者称其难以解释支撑如今许多成功公司的无形资产和研究支出。投资工具让按照价格-价值比筛选公司变得轻而易举，这意味着这种方法的潜在回报很可能会很快被套利掉。换句话说，公司看起来便宜，是有理由的。

This losing streak has led many to declare value investing dead. Critics say it struggles to account for the intangible assets and research spending that underpin many of today’s most successful firms. Investing tools make it easy to filter companies based on price-to-value ratios, meaning that potential returns from this approach will probably be arbitraged away fast. Firms left looking cheap, in other words, are cheap for a reason.

然而，担忧仍然存在，即今天牵头牛市的股票估值可能过高，以至于无法提供杰出的未来回报。一个广泛关注的指标是耶鲁大学的罗伯特·席勒（Robert Shiller）提出的循环调整市盈率（CAPE）比率，将价格除以过去十年的通胀调整后的收益。对于美国的标普500指数，CAPE比今天仅高过两次：互联网泡沫的顶峰，和2022年崩盘之前。即使不出现崩盘，高CAPE比率在历史上已被证明是一个强有力的指标，预示着未来长期的实际回报将疲软甚至为负。

The worry persists, though, that valuations of stocks leading today’s bull run have become too high for them to offer stellar future returns. A widely watched measure is the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio devised by Robert Shiller of Yale University, which divides prices by the past decade’s-worth of inflation-adjusted earnings. For America’s S&P 500 index, the CAPE has been higher than it is today only twice: at the peak of the dotcom bubble, and just before the crash of 2022. Even if a crash does not follow, a high CAPE ratio has historically proved to be a strong indicator that poor or even negative long-run real returns lie ahead.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_FNC032.png)

对于基金管理公司Elm Partners的维克多·哈格尼（Victor Haghani）来说，答案很明显：放眼全球。在更广泛的世界范围内，估值较低（参见图表2）。哈格尼先生计算得出，尽管美国股票的总体市盈率远高于其他地方，大约40%的其基础收益来自海外。而在全世界其他地方，约20%的总收益来自美国。换个角度看，这两组公司的利润实际上来源广泛。

For Victor Haghani of Elm Partners, a fund-management outfit, the response is obvious: look beyond America. In the wider world, valuations are lower (see chart 2). Mr Haghani calculates that, although American stocks attract a much higher aggregate price-to-earnings multiple than those elsewhere, around 40% of their underlying earnings come from overseas. In the rest of the world, some 20% of total earnings derive from America. Put another way, there is a strong degree of crossover in where the profits of the two groups of companies are actually made.

尽管如此，市场给予来自美国和其他地方的收益的估值差异巨大。哈格尼先生的数据分析表明，为了从收益转化为股价（对美国和非美国股票均适用），投资者正将产自美国的收益提高了40倍以上。对于来自其他地区的收益来说，相应的比例仅为十倍。这种差异并不合理。认为美国企业应得到更高的估值是有道理的，因为它们的增长潜力存在某种**杰出**之处。但为什么源自美国的收益会比其他地方的收益更大幅地推高股价呢？

Despite this, the values the market assigns to earnings derived from America and elsewhere are wildly different. Mr Haghani’s number-crunching suggests that, to get from earnings to share prices (for both American and non-American stocks), investors are scaling up those coming from America by a factor of over 40. For earnings coming from the rest of the world the equivalent scaling factor is just ten. Such a disparity makes little sense. It is one thing to suggest American firms deserve a higher valuation because there is something exceptional about their growth potential. But why should earnings originating from America boost a share’s price so much more than those from elsewhere?

也许，美国以外的国家的股市（或者说这些国家的收益）之所以看起来更便宜，只是因为它们确实更差。这正是市场最终可能通过提高非美国公司分配的估值，降低美国公司的估值，或两者兼有来纠正的定价失调。此外，虽然**价值**投资通常涉及对个别公司或行业进行集中投注，但押注这种重新定价可以将风险分散到全球大部分地区。

Perhaps the stockmarkets of countries outside America (or, equivalently, the earnings coming from these countries) are simply underpriced in relative terms. This is just the sort of mispricing that markets may eventually correct by raising the valuations assigned for non-American firms, lowering those of American firms, or both. What is more, whereas value investing often involves taking concentrated bets on individual companies or sectors, betting on this repricing allows the risk to be spread across most of the world.

事实上，甚至认为美国外的公司目前获得低估是因为它们缺乏活力的观点已经站不住脚了。这经常是用每个市场的部门构成来描述的：美国充满了明天的颠覆性科技公司，而欧洲充斥着呆板的银行和工业公司。

In fact, even the argument that companies outside America merit their current low valuations because they lack dynamism is threadbare. It is frequently couched in terms of the sectoral composition of each market: America’s is brimming with the disruptive tech firms of tomorrow, while Europe’s, for example, is stuffed with stodgy banks and industrial outfits.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_FNC033.png)

但摩根大通资产管理公司的休·金伯（Hugh Gimber）对欧洲公司估值较低的这个解释提出异议。他的团队根据每个部门将欧洲公司分组，分析了他们的收入被放大到股价的历史倍数，然后将这些与美国公司的等效倍数进行了比较。在大多数部门中，欧洲公司的股票在长期平均折扣中受到影响。然而今天，这些折扣在每个部门中都存在，并且比其长期平均水平要深得多（见图表3）。这些公司可能仅仅因为没有参与前沿行业而受到低估，而非失败。

But Hugh Gimber of JPMorgan Asset Management pours cold water on the idea that this explains the lower valuations of European firms. His team has split the continent’s companies by sector, analysed the historical multiples by which their earnings have been scaled up to generate their share prices, then compared these with the equivalent multiples for American firms. In most sectors, the European companies’ stocks have suffered from long-run average discounts. Today, though, these discounts are present in every sector—and are much deeper than their long-run averages (see chart 3). Rather than failing to operate in cutting-edge industries, such firms might simply be underpriced.

不仅是在欧洲存在着这种潜在的价值交易。金伯先生指出，在一系列新兴市场中，这些市场处于有利地位，可以从全球趋势中获利，而且估值远没有美国那么令人触目惊心。例如从受惠于**西方供应链**“亲密关系”转移的墨西哥和越南，到乘“**人工智能**”浪潮的韩国和台湾。资产管理公司Man Group的延斯·弗伦巴赫（Jens Foehrenbach）指出，东京证券交易所已设定了明确的目标，激励公司采取行动，提高其股价对账面净资产的比率（公司市值除以其净资产）。日本TOPIX指数的42%成分股尚未达到这一标准，这对那些认为它们会做到的投资者来说是一个赌注。

It is not just in Europe that such potential value trades abound. Mr Gimber points to a range of emerging markets that are well placed to profit from global trends, and where valuations are nowhere near as eye-watering as in America. Examples range from Mexico and Vietnam—benefiting from the “friendshoring” of Western supply chains—to countries riding the AI wave, such as South Korea and Taiwan. Jens Foehrenbach of Man Group, an asset manager, notes that the Tokyo Stock Exchange has set an explicit target, prodding firms to take actions that will raise their shares’ price-to-book ratios (the firm’s market value divided by its net assets) above 1. Some 42% of constituents of Japan’s Topix index have yet to reach this, suggesting a bet for those who think that they will.

所有这些市场的一个统一特征是，正如任何**价值**投资一样，押注在它们身上需要一次信仰的飞跃。美国股市表现优异之久，越来越像是理所当然的事情。也许在其他地方上市的公司看起来更便宜，只是因为它们实际上更糟。但有迹象显示，专业投资者已经无法继续容忍这种价格差异。三月份，全球基金经理告诉美国银行的调查，他们月月向欧洲和新兴市场股票调整他们的股票配置比例多于多年来所做的。任何被低估的股票可能不会长时间保持低估。■

A unifying feature of all such markets is that—like any value investment—betting on them involves a leap of faith. The longer America’s stockmarket outperforms the rest, the more it seems like the natural way of things. Maybe companies listed elsewhere look cheaper because they are simply worse. But there are signs that the pricing differentials have grown too large for professional investors to continue tolerating. In March global fund managers told Bank of America’s survey that, month on month, they had rotated more of their equity allocations into European and emerging-market stocks than they had done for years. Any that are underpriced may not remain so for long. ■

欧洲经济正面临来自四面八方的攻击 (Europe’s economy is under attack from all sides)
===============================================================

先是普京，接着是习。下一个会是特朗普吗？ (First Putin, now Xi. Next Trump?)
----------------------------------------------------

![An illustration of a Euro sign with plasters as the bars across it](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_FND002.jpg)

一十年前，习近平受到德国鲁尔河谷杜伊斯堡的欢迎。他赞扬该地区是中国投资的中心，迎接了一列从重庆经由俄罗斯到欧洲工业区的火车，并欣赏了矿业传统歌曲的管弦乐表演。不久前，另一批中国产品抵达德国却受到了冷淡的对待。今年二月，一艘名为“比亚迪探险者1号”(*BYD Explorer No. 1*)的船卸载了大约3000辆中国电动车，这些车是由中国电动汽车公司**比亚迪**制造的。正如船名所示，这很可能只是第一批。难怪这引发了对德国自豪的汽车制造商未来的担忧。

A decade ago Xi Jinping was welcomed to Duisburg in Germany’s Ruhr valley. He praised the region as a hub for Chinese investment; greeted a train that had spent a fortnight travelling from Chongqing, via Russia, to Europe’s industrial belt; and enjoyed an orchestral performance of traditional mining songs. More recently, another Chinese arrival in Germany received a frostier reception. In February a ship called *BYD Explorer No. 1* unloaded 3,000 or so electric cars made by BYD, a Chinese electric-vehicle (EV) firm. As the ship’s name suggests, it is likely to be the first of many. Little surprise that it has prompted worries about the future of Germany’s hallowed carmakers.

中国正在大量生产汽车，领导人注入资金和贷款到高科技产业，试图复兴濒临崩溃的经济。中国的制造贸易顺差占全球GDP的比例接近创纪录高位，而且有望进一步上升。欧洲领导人担心高级廉价中国商品的大量涌入。三月五日，欧洲委员会决定已有足够证据宣布中国对其电动车制造商提供了不公平补贴，为征收关税铺平了道路。欧盟委员会主席乌苏拉·冯·德·莱恩已警告中国不要在绿色技术上“南辕北辙”。英国已开始调查该国的挖掘机。法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙将于五月接待习近平。根据外交人员的说法，他将对贸易发出“坚决信息”。

China is churning out cars, as its leaders funnel cash and loans to high-tech industry in an attempt to revive the country’s moribund economy. Its manufacturing trade surplus is close to a record high as a share of global GDP, and is set to rise higher still. As a result, European leaders are fearful of an influx of advanced, cheap Chinese goods. On March 5th the European Commission decided that it had sufficient evidence to declare China had unfairly subsidised its EV-makers, paving the way for tariffs. Ursula von der Leyen, the commission’s president, has warned China not to “race to the bottom” on green tech. Britain has begun a probe into the country’s excavators. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, will host Mr Xi in May. He will, according to diplomats, deliver “firm messages” on trade.

从巴西到印度等国家都在采取措施阻止中国的出口。然而，中国的出口特别威胁到欧洲生产商，因为欧洲长期以来一直将贸易置于发展模式的核心位置。据国际货币基金组织的研究人员称，欧洲是世界上对贸易和投资最开放的地区（见图表1）。在欧盟，商品和服务贸易占GDP的比重达到44%，几乎是美国的两倍。作为一个基于规则的集团，欧盟不愿通过设置障碍来违反贸易规则。同样如此的是英国，后者一直支持自由贸易。

Countries from Brazil to India are moving to block China’s exports. They are a particular threat to Europe’s producers, though, because of the continent’s growth model, which has long had trade at its heart. According to IMF researchers, Europe is the region of the world most open to trade and investment (see chart 1). In the EU trade in goods and services runs to 44% of GDP, almost twice as much as in America. As a rules-based bloc, the EU is reluctant to violate trade rules too blatantly by erecting barriers. So is Britain, which has a history of support for free trade.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_FNC114.png)

新的中国冲击发生在欧洲工业正值困境之际。它仍在应对由俄罗斯入侵乌克兰引起的能源冲击，而这恰恰发生在各国领导人试图加快绿色转型之时。 2022年，天然气价格通常在每兆瓦时20欧元（22美元）左右，却飙升至超过300欧元，导致电力价格飞涨（见图表2）。后疫情反弹演变成通胀和能源危机。 欧洲央行被迫将利率提高至4%，打击了已经疲软的需求。

The new China shock arrives at a terrible time for European industry. It is still dealing with an energy shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which began just as national leaders were attempting to accelerate the green transition. Gas prices—usually around €20 ($22) per megawatt hour—spiked to more than €300 in 2022, sending electricity prices soaring (see chart 2). A post-covid rebound turned into inflation and an energy crisis. The European Central Bank (ECB) was forced to raise rates to 4%, hitting demand in an already weakened economy.

疫情期间的财政慷慨和能源危机后来被紧缩取代。德国紧张的赤字上限迫使该国今年大幅削减，2025年还将进一步削减。法国刚宣布2023年的赤字为GDP的5.5%，远高于预测。已经采取了应急措施，削减了100亿欧元支出以恢复财政政策正轨。

Fiscal largesse during the pandemic and energy crisis has since given way to retrenchment. Germany’s tight deficit limits have forced the country to cut back this year, with more cuts to come in 2025. France has just announced that its deficit in 2023 was 5.5% of gdp, well above forecasts. It had already pulled what Bruno Le Maire, its finance minister, calls an “emergency brake”, cutting €10bn of spending in order to bring fiscal policy back on track.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_FNC079.png)

自2019年以来，欧盟的实际GDP仅增长了4%，大约是美国的一半增速。英国和德国的人均GDP实际上有所下降（见图表3）。 欧盟和英国的官方预测显示，今年增长率预计不足1％；更远的未来则充满不确定性。尽管美国的生产力似乎在大流行期间上升，欧洲的则步履维艰。欧洲央行、各国领导人、智囊团，以及意大利前两位总理恩里科·莱塔和马里奥·德拉吉正在努力弄清楚其中原因。同时，另一个威胁已经出现：如果唐纳德·特朗普获得美国总统大选胜利，欧洲出口商可能会面临对其最有利市场销售征收关税的情况。

The EU’s gdp has grown by just 4% in real terms since 2019, which is around half the pace America has enjoyed. In Britain and Germany GDP per person has actually fallen (see chart 3). Official forecasts for the eu and Britain project growth of less than 1% this year; beyond that, things are uncertain. Whereas American productivity seems to have risen in the pandemic, Europe’s is limping along. The ECB, national leaders, think-tanks and two former Italian prime ministers, Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi, are trying to work out why. At the same time, another threat looms: if Donald Trump wins America’s presidential election, European exporters could be subject to tariffs on sales to one of their most lucrative markets.

因此，当欧洲经济在2022年的俄罗斯冲击下颤栗之际，它将如何应对来自中国的新冲击，也许还有美国的第三次冲击呢？第一次中国冲击发生在2001年，当时中国加入世贸组织并从更低的贸易壁垒中获益，对西方制造商构成挑战。在美国，有些地区和行业遭受了重创。欧洲幸免于难，在一定程度上是因为此次冲击与中欧国家加入欧盟同时发生。欧盟最新成员国的快速发展支撑了该集团的生产力增长，并创造了对西方商品的需求。

So as the continent’s economy reels from the Russia shock of 2022, how will it adapt to a new one from China and maybe a third from America? The first China shock came in 2001, when the country entered the WTO and benefited from lower trade barriers, posing a challenge to Western manufacturers. In America, some regions and sectors were hit hard. Europe got off more lightly, in part because the shock coincided with the accession of central and eastern European countries to the EU. The fast development of the EU’s newest members supported the bloc’s productivity growth and created demand for Western goods.

这一次情况将有所不同。尽管中国正朝着高科技制造业发展以应对经济困境，习近平也渴望让中国摆脱对西方产业的依赖。他希望建立在他认为对国家实力至关重要的领域——如工业机器人和铁路设备——的技术领先地位。一个更脆弱的中国要减少对外国投入的依赖，购买的汽车、机械和高科技设备将会减少，而这恰恰是在第一次中国冲击期间推动欧洲出口的商品类别。中国经济也比千禧之交时大得多。据顾问公司Absolute Strategy的亚当·沃尔夫指出，自2019年以来中国出口的增长——占该国GDP的比例适度——已经在其他地方产生了泛滥的感觉。

This time will be different. Although China is moving towards high-tech manufacturing in response to its economic struggles, Mr Xi is also keen to wean the country off Western industry. He wants to build technological leadership in sectors he sees as necessary for national strength, such as industrial robots and railway equipment. A weaker China aiming to be less dependent on foreign inputs will buy fewer cars, less machinery and less high-tech equipment, precisely the sort of goods that lifted European exports during the first China shock. China’s economy is also much larger than it was at the turn of the millennium. As Adam Wolfe of Absolute Strategy, a consultancy, notes, the rise in China’s exports since 2019—moderate as a share of the country’s GDP—has already felt like a deluge elsewhere.

此外，欧洲企业现在在日益复杂的市场上面临中国竞争，无论是在本土还是在第三国。以汽车业为例，这是欧洲工业的明珠。该行业及其供应链共雇佣了约300万欧洲人。然而，根据汽车顾问马蒂亚斯·施密特的数据，中国品牌已在西欧纯电池市场占据了9%的份额。在整个欧洲大陆，中资品牌消费者车辆的新注册量在2022年至2023年间翻了一番。法国、德国和意大利的大众市场品牌似乎特别容易受到竞争的冲击。瑞士银行UBS的分析师认为，“传统”汽车制造商的全球市场份额将从今天的81%下降到2030年的58%。

Moreover, European firms now face Chinese competition in increasingly sophisticated markets, both at home and in third countries. Take cars, the crown jewel of Europe’s industry. The sector, along with its supply chain, employs around 3m Europeans. Yet Chinese brands already make up 9% of the pure-battery market in western Europe, according to data from Matthias Schmidt, an automotive consultant. Across the continent, new registrations of Chinese-brand consumer vehicles more than doubled between 2022 and 2023. French, German and Italian mass-market brands appear to be especially vulnerable to competition. Analysts at UBS, a bank, reckon that “legacy” carmakers’ global market share will drop from 81% today to 58% by 2030.

欧洲领导人特别热衷于发展绿色产业，他们向气候过渡注入了数十亿欧元。然而，为大众市场生产的欧洲公司将很难与中国竞争对手提供的价值相抗衡。例如，根据全球风能委员会（一个行业组织）的数据，2022年中国已经主导风力涡轮机市场，市场份额达60%。这为中国的制造商提供了进一步创新所需的规模。而情况只朝一种方向发展。中国的工厂门口价格指数，即衡量工厂销售价格的指数，已经连续17个月下降，大致维持在2019年的水平。相比之下，欧盟的同一指数，即使排除能源成本，也比四年前高出近四分之一。

Europe’s leaders are particularly keen to develop green industries as they pour billions into the climate transition. Yet European companies producing for the mass market will struggle to compete with the value offered by their Chinese competitors. China already dominates wind turbines, for instance, with a market share of 60% in 2022, according to the Global Wind Energy Council, an industry body. That provides its manufacturers with the scale needed for further innovation. And things are only heading in one direction. China’s producer-price index, which measures prices at the factory gate, has been falling for 17 months, and is roughly at its level of 2019. The same index for the EU, even excluding energy costs, is almost a quarter above its level of four years ago.

欧洲自身试图“减少风险”以减少来自中国的关键输入并限制对高科技产品的投资和出口，这也将增加成本。最近，比勒费尔德大学的尤利安·欣兹及其合著者在一篇论文中研究了与中国及其盟国进行彻底脱钩的影响。对于与中国联系最为密切的欧洲经济主导德国而言，他们发现逐步调整将使国内生产总值减少1.2%，约与日本相当。其他主要欧洲国家和美国的GDP损失约为0.5%。中国的损失约为2%。

Europe’s own attempts to “de-risk” from China—that is, to source fewer critical inputs from the country and restrict investments and exports of high-tech goods to it—will also push up costs. In a recent paper Julian Hinz of Bielefeld University and his co-authors look at the effects of a hard decoupling from China and its allies. For Germany, the European economy most closely intertwined with China, they find that a gradual adjustment would cost 1.2% of GDP, around the same as for Japan. Other major European countries and America would lose about 0.5% of GDP. China’s loss would come to around 2%.

欧洲的降低风险成本将会在特朗普在十一月获胜的情况下变得更加难以承受。新关税对欧洲出口商来说是一个令人沮丧的前景，去年他们向美国出售了价值5000亿欧元的商品。事实上，欧盟的27个成员国中有20个对美国实现了商品贸易顺差。

Europe’s de-risking costs will become harder to bear if Mr Trump wins in November. New levies are a grim prospect for the continent’s exporters, which last year sold €500bn-worth of goods to America. Indeed, 20 of the EU’s 27 member states ran a goods-trade surplus with the country.

在特朗普的第一个任期期间，美国对铝和钢铁征收了高额关税，打击了欧洲生产商。欧洲以对美国产品实施自己的关税作为回击，其中包括波旁威士忌和摩托车。直到乔·拜登到来才让双方达成（有点脆弱的）休战。特朗普政府可能会更加痛苦。这位前总统提出对美国所有进口征收10%的关税。贸易顾问罗伯特·莱特希泽最近更进一步，在《经济学人》上主张可能需要实施更加“残酷”的关税政策。

Mr Trump stoked tensions during his first term, when America imposed hefty tariffs on aluminium and steel, hitting European producers. Europe replied with its own tariffs on American products, including bourbon and motorbikes. It took the arrival of Joe Biden for the two sides to reach a (somewhat shaky) truce. Trump 2.0 could be much more painful. The former president has proposed a 10% tariff on all America’s imports. Robert Lighthizer, who advises him on trade, has gone further, [arguing recently](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2024/03/08/donald-trumps-former-trade-chief-makes-the-case-for-more-tariffs) in *The Economist* that even more brutal tariffs might be “necessary”.

与此同时，在中欧之间的紧张关系方面，针对补贴和倾销的你挡我砸的调查可能会变得司空见惯。例如，中国政府清楚地知道是谁在背后策划了欧盟的**EV**调查：他们已经启动了对法国干邑的反倾销调查。法国设计了自己的电动汽车**EV**补贴，以排除中国品牌；中国企业向客户提供了同等额度的折扣，一位分析师称之为“向马克龙先生示以**一根中指**”。

The German Economic Institute, a think-tank, has calculated the possible impact. Imagine America applies 10% tariffs on its imports and punishes China with even higher tariffs. America’s own economy would take a hit, via higher consumer prices—but Europe’s would be hurt more. Germany’s total exports would be nearly 5% lower by 2028 than in a world with no new American tariffs. Private investment would also be hit. As a result, German GDP would be 1.2% lower, equivalent to a cumulative loss of €120bn-worth of output by 2028. A Trump administration might go even further, seeking to retaliate against Europe for its digital-services taxes, which target American tech firms, or for refusing to toe the president’s line on China.

能源、中国和特朗普的冲击组合可能导致欧洲经济长时间的重组。对于欧洲的消费者来说，这将是一种双面刃。贸易战使商品价格上涨，选择减少，但当中国补贴太阳能电池板时，欧洲的公用事业和家庭能够获得更便宜的能源。一些地区也可能受益。西班牙等具备太阳能潜力的国家，或者拥有水力和风力资源的瑞典，都可能吸引新的产业。事实上，今年早些时候，瑞典公司H2 Green Steel宣布已获得65亿欧元的资金，用于位于该国北部城市**卢勒奥**附近的工厂。

Meanwhile, when it comes to tensions between China and the EU, tit-for-tat probes into subsidies and dumping will probably become common. The Chinese government, for example, has a clear idea who is behind the EU’s EV probe: it has started an anti-dumping probe into French cognac. France has designed its own ev subsidies for consumers to exclude Chinese brands; Chinese firms offer customers a rebate of the same magnitude, in what one analyst calls “a single-finger greeting to Mr Macron”.

类似地，一些外国企业将希望在欧洲投资，以便在贸易困难时与客户靠近。波兰在2021年和2022年吸引了近300亿欧元的外国直接投资（**FDI**），到2023年可能同样多。这是该国在疫情大流行之前通常获得的两倍。外国直接投资目前占波兰资本支出的25%，而工业化国家的平均水平为5%左右。其中一部分流入来自德国工程公司博世和日本企业大金，它们都正在波兰建设热泵工厂。根据咨询公司安永的一项调查，67%的“国际决策者”预计他们公司在欧洲的业务规模会扩大，这比2021年的40%有所增长。其中可能包括国防公司，它们将向欧洲日益壮大的军队供应武器，并为中国的电动汽车制造商提供产品。

The combination of energy, China and Trump shocks could lead to an extended period of restructuring in the European economy. For the continent’s consumers, this would be a mixed blessing. Trade wars make goods pricier and reduce choice, but when China subsidises solar panels, European utilities and households get cheaper energy. Some regions could benefit, too. Countries such as Spain, with solar-power potential, or Sweden, with water and wind power, could attract new industries. Indeed, earlier this year H2 Green Steel, a Swedish firm, announced that it had secured €6.5bn in funding for its plant near Lulea in the country’s north.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_FND003.jpg)

但大部分的重组将不那么愉快。德国最大的汽车零部件供应商之一大陆公司正在裁员成千上万。博世公司正在裁减其汽车软件部门的1200个职位。汽车行业的其他公司也宣布了裁员计划。之前的中国冲击促进了技术进步，因为工人流向了进行创新投资的更具生产力的公司。但根据奥地利经济研究所的克劳斯·弗里森比克勒等人的研究，过去15年左右，受到中国竞争影响的公司显示出生产率增长放缓的迹象。

Similarly, some foreign firms will want to invest in Europe to be close to customers when trade is difficult. Poland attracted almost €30bn in foreign direct investment (fdi) in 2021 and 2022, and probably as much in 2023. That is twice the amount it typically received before the pandemic. FDI now makes up 25% of Poland’s capital spending, compared with an average of 5% or so in industrialised countries. Some of its inflows came from Bosch, a German engineering firm, and Daikin, a Japanese conglomerate, both of which are building heat-pump factories in the country. According to a survey by EY, a consultancy, 67% of “international decision-makers” expect their firm’s European presence to grow, up from 40% in 2021. That may include defence companies, which will supply the continent’s growing armed forces—and China’s EV-makers.

尽管德国是欧洲的制造强国，但这一**三重挑战**可能会影响整个欧洲大陆。那些在西欧拥有能源密集型产业或生产大众市场产品的地区可能会面临损失。即使那些最初不受影响的地区也可能看到当地成功企业更多地进行海外投资，因为他们在适应其他地方的保护主义政策。根据欧洲央行的一项调查，未来五年内，欧元区75%的大型企业预计将实现跨国多元化，将生产地点靠近销售地点，或将业务部分转移到政治立场更相近的国家。

But most of the restructuring will be less pleasant. Continental, one of Germany’s largest suppliers of car parts, is shedding thousands of jobs. Bosch is getting rid of 1,200 positions in its automotive-software division. Others in the car industry have also announced cuts. The previous China shock spurred technological advances as workers moved to more productive companies that invested in innovation. But over the past 15 or so years, firms exposed to Chinese competition have shown signs of slower productivity growth, according to research by Klaus Friesenbichler of the Austrian Institute of Economic Research and co-authors.

囊中羞涩的政府将能够减缓转型到新产业的过程是有限的。尤其是当他们承诺增加国防开支，且对于能够促进增长的大规模欧盟改革缺乏渴望时，情况尤其如此。欧盟最近批准了在未来几年内为云计算提供12亿欧元的公共补贴。正如另一家智库麦肯锡全球研究所所指出的，这大约相当于亚马逊网络服务公司年度投资的4%。边缘技术领域的专利主要由美国和中国公司注册。尽管欧盟拥有庞大的人口，但就很多方面而言，仍然存在规模的问题。内部商品贸易远非顺畅。服务市场仍然如同以往一样分散。

Although Germany is Europe’s manufacturing powerhouse, the triple challenge could affect the whole continent. Regions with energy-intensive industries or that produce mass-market products in western Europe stand to lose out. Even areas insulated from the initial effects may see successful local firms invest more overseas, as they adapt to protectionism elsewhere. Over the next five years some 75% of large businesses in the euro area expect to diversify across countries, move production closer to sales or shift parts of their businesses to more politically aligned countries, according to a survey by the ECB.

这留下了第二种方法——试图保留旧有方式——这不可避免会引发强烈的游说。在民粹右翼回潮的时代，很少有政治家愿意为失业负责。深化资本市场或整合电力市场等艰巨技术工作带来的回报并不会很快到来。在布鲁塞尔和巴黎，要求提供无益补贴和其他形式的保护主义的呼声正在增加。同时，德国受困于一个跨越地缘政治和产业政策的棘手问题，这个三党联盟无法就任何事情达成一致，更不用说解决问题。当政治家犹豫不决时，更多的比亚迪船只将驶向欧洲的港口。■

There are limits to what cash-strapped governments will be able do to ease the transition to new industries. This is especially true when they have promised to spend more on defence and there is little desire for the sort of grand EU reforms that could help stimulate growth. The bloc recently approved €1.2bn in public subsidies for cloud computing by seven countries over several years. As McKinsey Global Institute, another think-tank, points out, that comes to about 4% of the annual investment of Amazon Web Services. Patents in frontier technologies are registered mostly by American and Chinese firms. Despite its huge population, in many respects the EU still struggles for scale. Internal goods trade is far from seamless. Services markets are as fragmented as ever.

That leaves a second approach—seeking to preserve the old—for which lobbying is inevitably fierce. In an age when the populist right is resurgent, few politicians want to be blamed for job losses. Payoffs from doing the difficult, technical work of deepening capital markets or integrating electricity markets do not come quickly. In Brussels and Paris the clamour for unhelpful subsidies and other forms of protectionism is growing. Germany, meanwhile, is hamstrung by a three-party coalition that cannot agree on anything, let alone a thorny issue that cuts across geopolitics and industrial policy. As politicians prevaricate, more BYD ships will make the journey to Europe’s ports. ■

“华丽七人组”是如何误导的 (How the “Magnificent Seven” misleads)
=================================================

忘记那支股市明星超级组合。 (Forget the supergroup of stockmarket darlings)
----------------------------------------------------------

![Illustration of seven horses in the shape of a seven, with circles and arrows over them, like a game plan](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_FND004.jpg)

所有模型都是错误的，统计学家的箴言如是说，但有些模型是有用的。去年的这个时候，很多专家的模型开始变得更加错误和不太有用。共识预测是经济增长将陷入困境，股价将黯淡无光，而这还是在一批美国地区银行陷入困境之前。升息似乎注定会带来普遍痛苦。然而，事实却是，就在那个银行动荡的国家，股市开始飙升。到了夏天，美国标普500指数的领先股份已经从前一个秋季的低点上涨了28%。分析师们寻找新模型来解释发生的事情，而“**伟大的七巨头**”成为了受欢迎的选择。

All models are wrong, goes the statisticians’ adage, but some are useful. This time last year, plenty of pundits’ models started looking more wrong and less useful. The consensus forecast was a grim spell for economic growth and a dreary one for stock prices—and that was before a clutch of American regional banks buckled. Higher interest rates seemed set to cause pain everywhere. Instead, in the very country where the banking turmoil unfolded, the stockmarket began to soar. By the summer America’s S&P 500 index of leading shares had risen by 28% from a trough hit the previous autumn. Analysts hunted for a new model to explain what was going on, and the popular choice revolved around the “Magnificent Seven”.

原因是，这个科技巨头集团——**谷歌母公司**、**亚马逊**、**苹果**、**Meta**、**微软**、**英伟达**和**特斯拉**的股票表现得好像它们自己构成了一个市场。到6月初，标普500指数今年年初已上涨了12%，但几乎整个增长都归功于这七只股票，其他的493只股票集体横盘。到了7月，它们成为了指数中最大的七家公司。到了10月底，这**伟大的七巨头**自年初以来增加了3.4万亿美元（或增长了50%）的市场价值，而其他493家公司则损失了1万亿美元（下跌了3.8%）。苹果是该集团中表现最差的，但其股价仍上涨了30%。

The reason was that shares in this group of tech giants—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla—were acting as if they made up a market of their own. By the start of June the S&P 500 had risen by 12% since the beginning of the year, but virtually the entire gain was down to these seven stocks, with the other 493 having collectively moved sideways. By July they were the biggest seven companies in the index. By late October the Magnificent Seven had added $3.4trn (or 50%) to their combined market value since the start of the year, even as the other 493 had lost $1trn (3.8%). Apple was the group’s worst performer but had nevertheless seen its share price rise by 30%.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_FNC097.png)

唉，这支乐队已经瓦解。从10月27日开始的强劲牛市的一个特点是，**伟大的七巨头**不再像一支群体那样运转。在更广泛的标普500指数上涨了26%的情况下，其中三家公司已由领跑者变为了落后者：谷歌和苹果的股价表现不佳，而特斯拉的股价直接下跌。其余四家击败了指数，但涨幅迥异。微软只比标准普尔500指数的平均成员稍微做得更好，而英伟达的股价却激增了惊人的129%。这七家公司中的六家仍然是指数中最大的股票，但特斯拉已被沃伦•巴菲特的投资公司——**伯克希尔•哈撒韦**所取代。

Alas, the band has broken up. One feature of the storming bull run that began on October 27th is that the Magnificent Seven have stopped charging as a pack. As the broader S&P 500 has risen by 26%, three of the group have turned from leaders to laggards: the share prices of Alphabet and Apple have underperformed, while that of Tesla has fallen outright. The remaining four have beaten the index, but by wildly differing amounts. Whereas Microsoft has done only slightly better than the average S&P 500 member, Nvidia’s shares have rocketed by an astonishing 129%. Six of the seven are still the index’s largest stocks, but Tesla has been replaced by Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment vehicle.

发生了什么？去年春天，情势明显：**伟大的七巨头**将成为人工智能热潮的赢家。所有这些公司起步巨大，这将帮助它们经受住任何衰退并在研发上超过竞争对手。每家公司已经征服了其所在科技世界的各自领域，这意味着它们可能会继续比其他公司更聪明地行事。它们的巨额现金储备也降低了上升的利率看起来过于威胁的可能性。

What happened? Last spring the narrative was obvious: the Magnificent Seven would end up as the winners from the artificial-intelligence (AI) gold rush. All were enormous to begin with, which would help them weather any downturn and outspend rivals on research and development. Each had already conquered its respective niche of the tech world, meaning they could probably carry on outsmarting other firms. And their big cash balances stopped rising interest rates from looking too threatening.

部分原因是这个诱人的故事已经崩溃了，因为，像所有模型一样，从一开始就被过度简化了。**伟大的七巨头**这个“大科技”的概念，或者至少可以说“大科技”作为一个同质化的群体，一直都有点牵强。除了以万亿美元计的估值和大批聪明的员工外，一家人工智能芯片制造商（英伟达）与一家在线零售商（亚马逊）或一家社交网络供应商（Meta）之间没有太多共同之处。而一个成立于1975年的软件公司（微软）也不一定与一个成立于2003年的电动汽车制造商（特斯拉）分享同样的前景。在这一点上，**伟大的七巨头**概念并不孤单。想想“金砖四国”（巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非）这个组合的随意性，或者更大更模糊的“新兴市场”组合。

In part this seductive story has fallen apart because, like all models, it was oversimplified to begin with. The idea of the Magnificent Seven as “big tech” incarnate—or at least of “big tech” as a homogenous group—was always something of a stretch. Aside from trillion-dollar valuations and hordes of clever employees, a manufacturer of AI chips (Nvidia) does not have an awful lot in common with an online retailer (Amazon) or a purveyor of social networks (Meta). Nor does a software firm born in 1975 (Microsoft) necessarily share the prospects of an electric-vehicle maker established in 2003 (Tesla). In this, the Magnificent Seven concept was not alone. Think of the arbitrariness of the “BRICS” gang of countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), or of the even bigger and more amorphous “emerging markets” group.

然而，**伟大的七巨头**的解散也预示着一些更广泛的转变。其中一个是，随着去年的银行倒闭淡出人们记忆，投资者对于升息对经济的影响变得不那么焦虑。美国经济不仅没有陷入经济衰退，反而蓬勃发展。那些通过市场份额、利润率和现金储备抵御冲击的公司因此失去了一些“避风港”的吸引力。

Yet the disbanding of the Magnificent Seven signals some broader shifts, too. One is that, as last year’s bank failures fade from memory, investors have become less anxious about the impact of higher interest rates. America’s economy has defied recession forecasts and boomed instead. Firms that are insulated from shocks by big market shares, profit margins and cash buffers have thus lost some of their “safe haven” appeal.

它还表明，尽管市场上充满了乐观情绪，但并非所有的谨慎都被抛到了一边。一年前的生成式人工智能（AI）让投资者如此着迷，以至于科技巨头被默认为赢家。现在，这种默认的假设被撤回了。英伟达已经从其他公司中脱颖而出，因为它正将炒作转化为了高达天际的销售额和利润。苹果和特斯拉遭到惩罚，部分原因是它们未能说明自己将如何做到同样。投资者可能对人工智能感到兴奋，但对于那些担心泡沫的人来说，他们似乎也愿意保持怀疑态度。■

It also shows that, though optimism is surging through markets, not all caution has been thrown to the winds. A year ago generative AI so enthralled investors that tech giants were assumed to be winners by default. Now that automatic benefit of the doubt is being withdrawn. Nvidia has pulled away from the rest of the group as it is transforming hype into stratospheric sales and profits. Apple and Tesla are being punished, in part, for failing to communicate how they will do the same. Investors might be excited about AI but—encouragingly, for those who fear a bubble—they seem willing to be sceptical, too. ■

<hr><span style="color: red;"><b>科学技术 | 杀手的战术</b></span> (Science and technology | Killers’ tactics)

当猎食时，虎鲸会采用残忍而协调的攻击方式 (Killer whales deploy brutal, co-ordinated attacks when hunting)
==================================================================================

它们的技巧世代相传。 (Their techniques are passed down through the generations)
------------------------------------------------------------------

![虎鲸正在捕猎一只跳跃在空中的瓶鼻海豚](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_STP001.jpg)

在加利福尼亚海岸外的蒙特利潜水艇峡谷水域游荡的**虎鲸**是残忍的动物。当它们猎杀灰鲸时，它们会选择母子配对，追逐它们直至幼崽开始疲惫。此时，虎鲸通过在两者之间穿梭或拖着幼崽的尾鳍或鳍让它们分开。一旦幼崽与母亲分离，虎鲸会用头部和尾巴猛击幼崽，然后跃到幼崽的喷孔上方将其淹没，使其保持在水下无法浮起。

The killer whales that roam the waters of the Monterey Submarine Canyon, off the coast of California, are brutal animals. When hunting grey whales, they target mother and calf pairs, chasing them until the calves begin to tire. At that point the killer whales separate the grey whales by manoeuvring between them or dragging the calves away by their tail flukes or fins. Once a calf is separated from its mother, the killer whales incapacitate it by bludgeoning it with their heads and tails before drowning it by leaping atop its blowhole to keep it below the surface.

**虎鲸**（*Orcinus orca*）是一个多样的物种，在世界各地有几个隔离的种群，占据着不同的生态位，而在几种情况下，这些生态位仍未被充分描述。最近的两项研究揭示了潜伏在东北太平洋深水中的**虎鲸**的独特狩猎文化。

The killer whale (*Orcinus orca*) is a diverse species, boasting several isolated populations around the world that occupy varying—and, in several cases, still little described—ecological niches. Two recent studies have shed some light on the unique hunting cultures of the killer whales that stalk the deep waters off the north-east Pacific Ocean.

不同**虎鲸**种群被称为“生态型”，它们在大小、颜色和体态上可能有所不同。当它们的生态范围重叠时，这些生态型很少互动，似乎也不会杂交。构成**虎鲸**生态型差异的大部分内容是它们的文化——被认为是**虎鲸**一代又一代传承的社会学习行为。这些行为包括对不同海洋猎物物种的偏好以及用于定位、猎杀它们的协作策略，这些策略可能经过了几千年的磨练。不同的**虎鲸**生态型甚至会使用由点击、哨声和叫声组成的不同“方言”进行交流，而这些“方言”在**虎鲸**群之间会有所不同。

Distinct killer whale populations are known as “ecotypes” and can differ in size, colour and body proportion. Where their ecological ranges overlap, ecotypes rarely interact and do not appear to interbreed. Most of what makes killer-whale ecotypes distinct is their culture—socially learned behaviours that killer whales are known to transmit from one generation to the next. These include preferences for different marine prey species and the collaborative strategies used to locate, hunt and kill them, potentially honed over millennia. Different killer-whale ecotypes even communicate using distinct “dialects” made of clicks, whistles and calls, with “accents” that differ between pods.

最为研究的三个**虎鲸**生态型占据着东北太平洋海岸线，从阿拉斯加北部到加利福尼亚南部。“近海”**虎鲸**身长可达6.6米，以100至200只为一群在远离海岸的水域猎捕鲨鱼等近海鱼类。“定居”**虎鲸**约7米长，以25只为一群沿海岸线猎捕沿岸鱼类（主要是鲑鱼）。最后，“短途迁徙”**虎鲸**身长可达8米，分布于浅海和深海沿岸水域，捕猎包括鲸类（鲸和海豚）以及鳍足类动物（海狮和海豹）在内的海洋哺乳动物。虽然“近岸”短途迁徙**虎鲸**在靠近海岸的浅水中狩猎，但“远洋”短途迁徙**虎鲸**在大陆架边沿的峡谷深处开阔水域狩猎。

The most studied killer-whale ecotypes are the three that occupy the north-east Pacific coastline, from northern Alaska to southern California. “Offshore” killer whales, up to 6.6 metres long, patrol distant waters in pods of 100 to 200 individuals, hunting pelagic fishes like sharks. “Resident” killer whales, around 7 metres in length, stalk the coastline in pods of up to 25 individuals, targeting coastal fishes (primarily salmon). Finally, “transient” killer whales, each up to 8 metres in length, are found across both shallow and deep coastal waters and pursue marine mammals, including cetaceans (whales and dolphins), as well as pinnipeds (sea lions and seals). While “inner-coast” transients stalk shallow waters near the shore, “outer-coast” transients hunt in the deep open waters along canyons at the edge of the continental shelf.

为了更好地了解这些短途迁徙**虎鲸**，来自加拿大不列颠哥伦比亚大学的乔什·麦金尼斯领导了一个团队，分析了通过调查和观鲸船收集的关于蒙特利潜水艇峡谷系统周围的261次**虎鲸**目击记录。数据集中包括近100起捕猎事件。麦金尼斯在《PLOS ONE》杂志上发表他们的研究结果，发现外海长途迁徙**虎鲸**的行为模式与近海堂兄有所不同。后者伏击港海豹、海狮和偶尔的水獭，而前者在追捕较大的哺乳动物猎物时倾向于协作潜水。

To understand these transient killer whales better, Josh McInnes from the University of British Columbia in Canada led a team that analysed 261 sightings of killer whales around the Monterey Submarine Canyon System collected by surveys and whale-watching vessels. The dataset included almost 100 predation events. Publishing their results in the journal *PLOS ONE*, Mr McInnes found patterns in behaviour of outer-coast transients that differed from those of their inner-coast cousins. The latter ambushed harbour seals, sea lions and the occasional otter, while the former tended to perform co-ordinated dives in their hunt for larger mammalian prey.

外海长途迁徙**虎鲸**似乎已经发展出专门的策略——比如重复袭击和淹死灰鲸幼崽——因为它们的猎物更大，需要更长时间才能制服。像大多数专门化的**虎鲸**狩猎行为一样，这些策略被认为是代代相传的文化知识。

Outer-coast transients appear to have developed specialised strategies—such as the repeated battering and drowning of grey whale calves—because their prey is bigger and takes more time to subdue. Like most specialised killer-whale hunting behaviours, these strategies are thought to be honed, down the generations, as a form of cultural knowledge.

在研究外海长途迁徙**虎鲸**时，麦金尼斯还无意中发现了一种全新类别的大型猎物猎人**虎鲸**的线索。他的团队在《水生哺乳动物》杂志中描述了1997年至2021年间与49只**虎鲸**进行的九次近海遭遇。观察到这些**虎鲸**猎杀抹香鲸、小须鲸和大型里索氏海豚，以及在关注涟漪龟上进行清道夫活动。

While studying the outer-coast transients, Mr McInnes also stumbled upon hints of a previously undescribed population of killer whales that were big-game hunters of an entirely different class. Writing in the journal *Aquatic Mammals*, his team described nine offshore encounters with 49 killer whales between 1997 and 2021. These killer whales were seen killing sperm whales, pygmy sperm whales and large [Risso’s dolphins](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2018/06/16/when-faced-with-a-killer-whale-should-you-fight-or-flee), as well as scavenging on leatherback turtles.

对抹香鲸的攻击尤为惊人，因为抹香鲸的体型可能是成年**虎鲸**的十倍大。1997年10月21日，在四个小时内观察到15至35只**虎鲸**狩猎一群九只抹香鲸。抹香鲸遭受了一波接一波的侵袭，所有抹香鲸都受伤，其中几只严重受伤，最终一只抹香鲸被孤立并被杀死。在幸存下来的抹香鲸中，有三只被认为死于受伤，整个群体后来可能因伤口感染而死亡。

The attack on sperm whales, which can grow to around ten times larger than adult killer whales, was a particularly impressive show of predatory force. On October 21st 1997, between 15 and 35 killer whales were observed hunting a herd of nine sperm whales over the course of four hours. The sperm whales were subjected to repeated waves of aggressive attack, injuring all of them and severely injuring several before one sperm whale was finally isolated from the herd and killed. Out of the surviving sperm whales, three are thought to have died from the wounds they sustained and it is possible the entire herd later succumbed to its injuries.

目前关于这些**虎鲸**的了解还不多，除了它们被特有环切鲨咬伤留下的特征性圆形伤疤之外，这暗示这些高度攻击性的生物潜伏在北太平洋深水中游荡。

Little more than that is known about these killer whales for now, except that they are identifiable by characteristic circular scars left by bites from cookie-cutter sharks, which suggest these hyper-aggressive creatures stalk the deep waters of the north Pacific.

在科学家能够充分描述这些新的生态型并将其添加到海洋生物学教科书之前，还需要从外海长途迁徙**虎鲸**和那些恐吓北太平洋深海中的新发现的堕胎堡壬水域**虎鲸**那里收集更多数据，尤其是基因数据。然而，这些发现提醒我们生物多样性不仅仅体现在物种之间的多样性，也体现在物种内部的多样性。**虎鲸**看起来并不只是简单的黑白两色。■

More data, especially of the genetic kind, will need to be collected from both outer-coast transient killer whales as well as their newly discovered cousins terrorising the pelagic waters of the north Pacific, before scientists can fully describe the new ecotypes and add them to marine-biology textbooks. Nevertheless, the discoveries are a reminder that biodiversity is not just about the diversity between species but also within them. Killer whales seem to exist in many more shades than just black and white. ■

阿尔温德·凯杰里瓦尔的监禁是对印度民主的污点 (Arvind Kejriwal’s imprisonment is a stain on India’s democracy)
====================================================================================

他是印度历史上首位被逮捕的在任首席部长 (He is the first sitting chief minister in the country’s history to be arrested)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![阿尔温德·凯杰里瓦，印度反腐斗士和AAP领袖，在新德里被逮捕](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_ASP003.jpg)

距离印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪即将开始的大选还有三个多星期，他几乎没有理由担心选举结果。他的声望在国内外都**创下了** [历史新高](https://www.economist.com/international/2024/03/27/narendra-modis-secret-weapon-indias-diaspora)。预计他所在的人民党将轻松获得连任。但政府并未放松警惕。政府似乎加大了打压异见的力度。这让很多人担心，如果莫迪先生赢得第三个任期，他可能会对反对派更加缺乏宽容。

With just over three weeks to go until the start of a general election Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, has little reason to worry about the outcome. His popularity is at an [all-time high](https://www.economist.com/international/2024/03/27/narendra-modis-secret-weapon-indias-diaspora) both at home and abroad. His ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is expected to win re-election comfortably. But the government is not resting easy. It appears to have stepped up a campaign to quash dissent. That makes many concerned that, were Mr Modi to win a third term, he may become even less tolerant of the opposition.

3月21日，印度负责调查金融犯罪的两大机构之一“执法局”（ED）逮捕了德里首席部长、反对党“尊敬的共和党”（AAP）领袖阿尔温德·凯杰里瓦，作为腐败调查的一部分。他是今年第三位被逮捕的反对派领导人，也是印度历史上第一位被逮捕的在位首席部长。执法局指控他未能配合调查，因为他无视了九份传票，拒绝接受调查人员询问。AAP领袖否认有错误，并称自己是政治报复的受害者。3月26日，试图前往莫迪先生家抗议的他党成员被逮捕。反对派计划在3月31日举行一次大规模集会。

On March 21st the Enforcement Directorate (ED), one of two main Indian agencies tasked with investigating financial crimes, arrested Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi and the leader of the opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), as part of a corruption probe. He is the third opposition leader to be arrested this year and the first sitting chief minister to be arrested in India’s history. The ED accuses him of failing to co-operate with the probe after he ignored nine summons to be questioned by investigators. The AAP leader denies wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a political vendetta. On March 26th members of his party who were attempting to march to Mr Modi’s home in protest were arrested. A big rally by the opposition is planned for March 31st.

*Read more of our coverage of the [Indian election](https://www.economist.com/india-election-2024)*

不幸的是，这场镇压似乎是更广泛模式的一部分。就在凯杰里瓦先生被逮捕当天，主要全国反对党国大党声称，税务机关以其2017-18财年涉嫌未申报现金收入的理由冻结了其银行账户，导致无法支付竞选费用。3月26日，德里一家法院还延长了对来自印度南部泰伦甘纳邦的一名反对派议员的预审羁押，该议员本月早些时候因涉及和凯杰里瓦先生一样的调查而被捕。

This crackdown unfortunately appears to be part of a broader pattern. The same day as Mr Kejriwal’s arrest Congress, the main national opposition party, claimed that tax authorities had frozen its bank accounts over alleged undeclared cash income in the 2017-18 financial year, leaving it unable to cover campaign expenses. On March 26th a court in Delhi also extended the pre-trial custody for an opposition lawmaker from the southern state of Telangana, who was arrested earlier this month in connection with the same probe that snagged Mr Kejriwal.

同时，法院也一直拖延两名其他高级AAP领导人的保释申请，他们作为调查的一部分已经被关押六个月和十三个月，没有人被起诉。今年一月，执法局还以洗钱指控逮捕了东部邦贾坎德邦首席部长，该邦为反对党政府。他在被捕前数小时辞职。所有人都否认有错误。他们将无法在即将到来的选举中进行竞选活动。

Meanwhile the courts have also continued to defer pleas for bail from two other senior AAP leaders who have been in jail as part of the probe for six and 13 months, respectively. None has been put on trial. In January the ED also arrested the chief minister of Jharkhand, an opposition-run eastern state, on allegations of money-laundering. He resigned hours before his arrest. All deny wrongdoing. They will not be able to campaign in the upcoming election.

人民党表示执法机构独立于政府，只是在打击腐败方面做好自己的工作。它说，声称存在政治阴谋的反对派政客正在寻找借口，为自己在选举中“即将遭受及其可悲的失败”辩解。尽管如此，自2014年莫迪上台以来，大约95%的金融犯罪调查都针对反对派。相比之下，很少有人民党政治家深陷执法机关的批评。遭遇反贪官员困扰的反对派政治家一旦投奔人民党，他们的法律问题就会被搁置或拖延。

The BJP says that law-enforcement agencies are independent of the government, and are merely doing their job in rooting out corruption. It says that opposition politicians who allege a political conspiracy are trying to find excuses for their “imminent and miserable defeat” in the election. Even so, some 95% of financial-crime probes since Mr Modi took power in 2014 have targeted the opposition. By contrast few BJP politicians have found themselves in the crosshairs of law enforcement. Opposition politicians troubled by anti-corruption officials have seen their legal problems shelved or postponed as soon as they defected to the BJP.

越来越明显的是，人民党似乎不能容忍任何异议。批评政府的非政府组织和智库发现自己成为当局密切关注的对象。媒体普遍支持人民党，而司法系统在选择如何挑战政府方面也越来越具有选择性。

Increasingly it looks as if the BJP is unable to brook any dissent. NGOs and think-tanks that are critical of the government have found themselves subject to close attention by the authorities. The media is broadly pro-BJP, while the judiciary is increasingly selective about how it chooses to challenge the government.

尽管这些针对凯杰里瓦等人的行动时间存疑，但调查仍很可能对反对派造成重大伤害，同时对莫迪政府的选举风险很小。本月早些时候有关通过“选举债券”进行的有争议的企业捐款的披露，尽管主要涉及人民党，但未激起选民或反腐官员的强烈反响。莫迪先生依然非常受欢迎，最近的一项调查显示，高达78%的受访者对他表示支持。即使没有最近的打压行动，他也会轻松赢得一场民主选举。 ■

Despite the questionable timing of the moves against Mr Kejriwal and others, the probes are still likely to inflict considerable damage on the opposition, while posing little electoral risk to Mr Modi’s government. Disclosures earlier this month of controversial corporate donations through “electoral bonds”, which the Supreme Court ordered in February, have not roused voters or anti-corruption officials, despite the fact they were largely to the BJP. Mr Modi remains incredibly popular, with fully 78% of those polled in a recent survey approving of him. He would easily win a democratic election, even without the recent crackdown. ■



<hr><span style="color: red;"><b>亚洲 | 伊姆兰·汗在监狱</b></span> (Asia | Imran Khan in prison)

巴基斯坦接下来会怎样？ (What next for Pakistan?)
==================================

新政府面临两极分化的政治、摇摇欲坠的经济和恐怖威胁 (The new government faces polarised politics, a faltering economy and terrorist threats)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Supporters of the party of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Imran Khan, chant slogans in Karachi](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_ASP001.jpg)

支持巴基斯坦前总理伊姆兰·汗所在党派的支持者在卡拉奇高呼口号

A stint in jail is a rite of passage for civilian Pakistani leaders bold enough to challenge the country’s generals. Imran Khan is doing his penance these days in Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail. Judges sentenced the 71-year-old former cricketer turned populist politician to 31 years earlier this year after convictions on religious, corruption and national-security charges. Because candidates allied with his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), managed nonetheless to win more national-assembly seats in February’s election than any rival party, Mr Khan is in “extremely high spirits”, says his sister Aleema, a regular visitor. He passes his time reading and keeping fit on a stationary bike in his cell.

对于那些足够大胆挑战巴基斯坦将军的民选领导人来说，坐牢都是一种成年礼。如今伊姆兰·汗正在拉瓦尔品第的阿迪亚拉监狱里做着自己的苦修。法官们今年早些时候因涉及宗教、腐败和国家安全指控，判处这位71岁的前板球运动员转型为民粹政治家的前总理31年监禁。尽管伊姆兰所领导的政党巴基斯坦正义运动党(PTI)的候选人在2月的选举中赢得了比任何对手党派更多的全国议会席位，伊姆兰的姐姐Aleema表示他“精神状态极好”，她经常前去探望。伊姆兰在狱中通过阅读和在囚室里踩单车保持健康度过时间。

The image of Mr Khan pedalling furiously while stuck in place seems an apt metaphor for Pakistan’s post-election politics. PTI’s unexpected success at the polls demonstrated the party’s resilience under pressure. Yet while it has managed to form one provincial government, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, PTI’s leaders are otherwise marginalised. Shehbaz Sharif, the prime minister, enjoys firm backing from “the establishment”, as Pakistan’s armed forces are euphemistically known. He now leads a minority national administration anchored in his family’s dynastic party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). Mr Sharif recently put the finishing touches to a cabinet of technocrats and traditional politicians. After two tumultuous years, he could be forgiven for hoping for calm.

伊姆兰在原地如疾驰的画面，似乎是对巴基斯坦选举后政治的准确隐喻。PTI在选举中意外获得成功，展现了该党在压力下的韧性。然而，尽管PTI设法组建了开伯尔-普什图省的一个省级政府，但该党的领导人在其他方面却被边缘化。总理谢巴兹·谢里夫享受着来自“建制派”的坚定支持，巴基斯坦武装部队委婉地称之为军方。他现在领导着一家以其家族世袭党派——巴基斯坦穆斯林联盟-纳瓦兹派(PML-N)为中坚的少数民族国家政府。谢里夫最近完成了由技术专家和传统政治家组成的内阁。经历了两年的动荡后，他可能希望恢复平静。

But he is likely to find it elusive. Mr Sharif’s government faces three challenges in the coming months. The first is that Mr Khan is determined to overturn the status quo, even from prison. Outraged by allegations of vote-rigging during the February vote, PTI leaders say they will seek redress in parliament, the courts and through peaceful street protests. Their goals include a new election and liberty for Mr Khan and other jailed leaders. “I have no doubt—and I think the party feels very confident—the so-called result of this election will be overturned,” says Taimur Jhagra, a former PTI provincial minister, referring to the evidence of vote fraud that the party is submitting to the courts.

但他可能会发现这是难以实现的。谢里夫政府在未来几个月将面临三大挑战。第一个挑战是伊姆兰决心要改变现状，即使在监狱里也是如此。PTI领导人对2月份选举期间的操纵指控感到愤怒，他们表示将通过议会、法庭以及和平示威来寻求补救。他们的目标包括举行新选举以及让伊姆兰及其他被监禁领导人获得自由。“毫无疑问—我认为整个党派感到非常有信心—这次选举的所谓结果将被推翻，”PTI前省部长Taimur Jhagra表示，指的是该党向法院提交的选举舞弊证据。

Yet Pakistan’s judges rarely defy the army’s preferences on big political matters. And since February, the government has used social-media blackouts and overwhelming shows of force by police to suppress PTI’s attempts to stage public demonstrations. General Asim Munir, the powerful army chief, is not signalling room for compromise. In a recent statement following a conference of top generals, the military denounced those in Pakistan who are “creating political instability and uncertainty” by resorting to “emotional outbursts”, a transparent reference to PTI.

![](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_ASC111.png)

然而，巴基斯坦的法官很少违抗军方在重大政治事务上的偏好。自2月以来，政府利用社交媒体封锁和警方的压倒性示威力量，镇压了PTI试图举行公开示威活动的企图。强大的军方首领Asim Munir将军并未示意妥协的余地。在最近一份声明中，在顶级将军会议之后，军方谴责那些通过“情绪爆发”诉诸“制造政治不稳定和不确定性”的巴基斯坦人，这明显是指PTI。

Even if he overcomes Mr Khan’s pressure campaign, Mr Sharif has a second big problem: Pakistan’s volatile economy, which is in the middle of a multi-year crisis. GDP shrank slightly in 2023 amid high debt, a balance-of-payments crisis and inflation that peaked at near 40% before falling back to its current rate of 23%. Before the election, while heading a government that lasted 16 months, Mr Sharif staved off disaster by securing a $3bn stand-by emergency loan from the IMF. That arrangement expires in April. Mr Sharif and a successor caretaker administration earned credit for delivering a primary fiscal surplus. But they were unable to advance the deep reforms that Pakistan has long needed, such as privatisation of state-owned enterprises saddled with zombie debt or an expansion of the tax net.

即使他抵抗住伊姆兰的施压运动，谢里夫先生还有第二个大问题：巴基斯坦动荡不安的经济。该国的GDP在2023年略微下降，在高债务、外汇危机和通货膨胀高达接近40%之后回落至目前的23%。选举前，在担任长达16个月的政府期间，谢里夫通过从国际货币基金组织(IMF)获得了30亿美元的紧急备用贷款来避免灾难。这项安排将在4月到期。谢里夫和接任的看管政府因交付主要财政盈余而受到认可。但他们未能推动巴基斯坦长期所需的深层次改革，例如处于僵尸债务困境中的国有企业的私有化，或扩大征税范围。

The new government is expected to return to the IMF for a larger and longer-term package. If agreed it would be the 25th IMF bail-out in Pakistan’s 77-year history, placing the country among the most profligate of fund borrowers. There seems little doubt that a new multi-year arrangement is attainable, perhaps in the range of $6bn. “Even our enemies don’t want us to fail or default,” notes Miftah Ismail, who served as finance minister during 2022. A new IMF programme will seek to reduce Pakistan’s staggering debt levels, which some analysts now regard as unsustainable.

预计新政府将再次向IMF寻求更大规模、更长期的援助。如果达成协议，这将是巴基斯坦77年历史上的第25次IMF救助，将该国列入最挥霍的资金借款国之一。有理由相信，新的多年协议是可行的，或许规模在60亿美元左右。“即使是我们的敌人也不希望我们失败或违约，”曾在2022年担任财政部长的Miftah Ismail指出。新的IMF计划将致力于减少巴基斯坦惊人的债务水平，一些分析师现在认为这些债务水平已经难以为继。

As a nuclear-armed nation of 242m, Pakistan is indeed too big to fail. Yet this has only entrenched complacency and corruption, encouraging its leaders to rely on emergency external finance and temporary fiscal adjustments rather than stomach economic restructuring.

作为一个拥有2.42亿人口的核武器国家，巴基斯坦确实是太大而不能失败。然而，这也仅仅加深了满足自满和腐败，鼓励其领导人依赖紧急的外部财政支持和暂时的财政调整，而不是接受经济改革的现实。

Will this time be different? Mr Sharif has raised hopes by recruiting Muhammad Aurangzeb, a Wharton-educated CEO of one of Pakistan’s largest private banks, as his finance minister. Mr Aurangzeb has pledged to carry out ambitious reforms and declared after his appointment that he would tolerate “no debates, no waste of time: just a steadfast commitment to implementation”. But whether Mr Sharif will give him the backing to follow through is uncertain.

这一次会有所不同吗？谢里夫通过招募巴基斯坦最大私营银行之一的沃顿商学院毕业的CEO穆罕默德·奥朗则布来担任财政部长，引发人们的希望。奥朗则布承诺进行雄心勃勃的改革，并在任命后表示将“不容争论，不浪费时间：只是坚定致力于实施”。但谢里夫是否会给予他支持来推动这些改革是不确定的。

A plan to sell off debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) will provide an early test. Forty years ago PIA offered service superior to its state-owned counterparts in India. But during the 1990s, the rise of formidable Gulf competitors like Emirates, and competition stimulated by an open-skies policy, caused the carrier’s market share to crumble. By 2017 PIA had 550 employees for every aircraft, more than two-and-a-half times its target. The airline now staggers under more than $3bn-worth of rupee debts. Mr Sharif has initiated a scheme to erase PIA’s debts and split the company into two parts, so that core operations could be offered for sale.

一项出售深陷债务的巴基斯坦国际航空公司(PIA)的计划将提供一个早期测试。四十年前，PIA在服务上超越了其印度国有公司的同行。但是在上世纪90年代，强大的海湾竞争对手如阿联酋航空的崛起，以及开放航权政策促进的竞争，导致了该公司的市场份额大幅下降。到2017年，PIA每架飞机拥有550名员工，超过其目标的2.5倍以上。这家航空公司目前背负着超过30亿美元的卢比债务。谢里夫已经启动了一项计划，用以抹去PIA的债务，并将该公司分拆为两个部分，以便核心业务能够进行出售。

The PIA case hints at some of the problems that have long bedevilled would-be modernisers in the country. Privatisation of state-owned firms hits workers, their families and unions: groups that are politically well-connected and which have in effect vetoed even the most common-sense divestments of state assets. Other reforms hit many more citizens and thus are even more politically sensitive. These ideas include stopping the government fixing prices; taxing retail and agriculture, previously exempt sectors; or withdrawing expensive fuel subsidies. Whenever such changes are attempted, however, they provoke huge protests amplified by social media and only partially free broadcasters.

PIA案例暗示了一些长期困扰该国的改革者的问题。国有企业私有化会影响到工人、他们的家庭和工会：这些群体在政治上有着良好的联系，实际上否决了国有资产的最基本剥离。其他改革会影响更多公民，因此更具有政治敏感性。这些想法包括停止政府定价、对先前免税领域(零售和农业)征税，或者取消昂贵的燃料补贴。然而，只要这些改变尝试了，就会引发大规模抗议，社交媒体和部分自由广播放大了这种抗议。

Pakistan’s military-managed, constrained democratic set-up also prevents civilian leaders from taking bold action. Mr Khan’s rise and fall is a case in point: the armed forces were widely seen as his backers in 2018. Four years later, they were seen as being behind Mr Khan’s sacking.

巴基斯坦军方管理、受限制的民主体系也阻止了民选领导人采取大胆行动。伊姆兰的崛起与没落就是一个例子：2018年，军方被普遍视为他的支持者。四年后，军方又被认为是幕后推动了伊姆兰被革职的人。

A third test for the new government comes in the form of a campaign of terror mounted by the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), the Pakistani branch of the Taliban movement. Since the Afghan Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, TTP-linked attacks in Pakistan have surged, claiming more than 2,200 lives, according to the government. Many victims have been members of the security forces. The latest TTP attack took place on March 16th when suicide-bombers hit an army base on the Afghan frontier, killing at least seven soldiers. Pakistani jets launched a retaliatory strike against alleged TTP targets inside Afghanistan.

新政府面临的第三个挑战是来自巴基斯坦塔利班运动(TTP)发起的恐怖活动。自2021年阿富汗塔利班接管喀布尔以来，TTP相关的袭击在巴基斯坦激增，政府称已造成2200多人死亡。许多受害者是安全部队成员。最近的TTP袭击发生在3月16日，自杀炸弹袭击者袭击了阿富汗边境上的一个军事基地，造成至少7名士兵死亡。巴基斯坦战机对阿富汗境内据称的TTP目标进行了报复性打击。

There exists a serious risk of escalation. Pakistan accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban regime of providing aid and sanctuary to the TTP. “Terrorism against us is mostly being conducted from Afghanistan,” Khawaja Asif, Pakistan’s defence minister, said after the latest attack. During the past two years, Pakistan has tried many forms of persuasion and coercion to influence the Taliban’s restored regime in Kabul. The efforts have included diplomatic negotiations, halting cross-border trade, expelling Afghan refugees from Pakistan and military action. None of this has worked. Although the Afghan Taliban have issued decrees banning Afghans from fighting inside Pakistan, the attacks and accusations of Kabul’s complicity persist.

存在着严重的升级风险。巴基斯坦指责阿富汗塔利班政权向TTP提供援助和庇护。在最新一次袭击后，巴基斯坦国防部长Khawaja Asif表示：“大部分针对我们的恐怖主义行为都是从阿富汗发动的。”在过去两年中，巴基斯坦尝试了许多形式的劝说和胁迫，以影响喀布尔恢复的塔利班政权。这些努力包括外交谈判、停止跨境贸易、将阿富汗难民遣返以及军事行动。但这一切都没有奏效。虽然阿富汗塔利班发布命令禁止阿富汗人在巴基斯坦内部战斗，但这种攻击和指责阿富汗共谋仍在持续。

Mr Sharif has long accommodated the armed forces. Decisions about how to handle the Taliban regime in Kabul will fall to General Munir. The army chief is a more reticent figure than some of his predecessors. Well-connected analysts say the general seems mainly interested in shoring up Pakistan’s bedrock alliance with China and its historical ties to Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, where the general paid a visit on March 20th.

巴基斯坦的悲剧在于无法维持一个可行的政治共识。“我们经济糟糕的原因在于每三年按下自毁按钮，然后重新开始，”前巴基斯坦正义运动（**PTI**）省部长贾格拉称。但认识问题和解决问题是两回事。现实情况是，如果卡汗先生希望实现政治复兴，他可能需要获得穆尼尔将军的祝福或与其他主要民间政党达成和解协议。然而，两者都似乎不太可能。

General Munir also visited America late last year, hosted by Central Command, the military force responsible for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pakistan’s correct if largely transactional relations with Washington these days offer a modest hedge against its dependency on China and help to ease its dealings at the IMF.

卡汗先生的个人魅力和反抗精神为他的政党和国家带来了一次过山车之旅。在监狱中度过的日子里，他最近告诉他的妹妹，“我现在忙着获取知识”，他通过阅读历史、政治和苏非主义来获得新的见解。也许卡汗先生可以通过与将军和政治对手分享新的见解来帮助克服国家的功能障碍。他可以从鲁米，最著名的苏非诗人开始：“昨天我是如此聪明，所以我想要改变世界。今天我变得明智，所以我开始改变自己。” ■

General Munir may also want more influence over the country’s economy. Last year he touted a new body, the Special Investment Facilitation Council, on which he sits, that he said would create “an investor-friendly system that avoids unnecessary delays and provides easy terms and conditions for business”, particularly in mining and agriculture. The apparent purpose is to attract direct investment from Gulf sovereign-wealth funds and elsewhere. Yet it will be hard for Pakistan to advertise itself as a stable destination for investment as long as its most popular politician is locked up on dubious charges and his supporters clamour for redress.

Pakistan’s tragedy has been its inability to sustain a workable political consensus. “The reason our economy stinks is that every three years we press a self-destruct button and start from zero again,” says Mr Jhagra, the former PTI provincial minister. But it is one thing to be aware of the problem and another to solve it. The reality is that if Mr Khan wishes to achieve political rehabilitation, he would probably require either General Munir’s blessing or a reconciliation pact with other major civilian parties. Neither seems likely.

Mr Khan’s charisma and defiance has delivered a rollercoaster ride to his party and his country. During his sojourn in prison, he recently told his sister, “I’m really busy getting knowledge” by reading about history, politics and Sufism. Perhaps Mr Khan can help overcome his country’s dysfunction by sharing new-found insights with generals and rival politicians. He might start with Rumi, the best-known Sufi poet: “Yesterday I was so clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.” ■

越南国家元首蒙上阴影离职 (Vietnam’s head of state leaves under a cloud)
========================================================

投资者应该担心该国政治状况。 (Investors should worry about the state of the country’s politics)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![插图：一只老鼠嘴里叼着钱](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_ASD001.jpg)

越南共产党是地球上最隐秘的组织之一。它向自己的人民和世界展现的外表是慎独、一致和共识性秩序。因此，在去年初失去一位国家元首，因贪污而下台，显得有些疏忽。在去年三月底再度失去第二位国家元首离任，毫无疑问地令人不安。这不仅关乎普通越南民众，还有外国投资者，他们将押注于越南作为东南亚最炙手可热的经济体。

The Communist Party of Vietnam is among the most secretive bodies on Earth. The façade it presents to its own people and to the world is one of circumspection, conformity and consensual order. So to lose one head of state early last year, departing under a cloud of corruption, was careless. To lose a second, Vo Van Thuong, in late March is downright disconcerting. It is not just ordinary Vietnamese who should care. So, too, should foreign investors, who have bet big on Vietnam as the hottest economy in South-East Asia.

年仅50多岁的阮日光是有史以来最年轻的总统。作为一名宣传高手，他认为自己前途无限。他接替了阮春福，后者在去年一月因涉及疫情检测试剂骗局而辞职（他坚称自己和家人均未参与其中）。阮日光热衷于公开角色。然而，越南突然取消了荷兰国王和王后计划的访问。然后，在3月20日，党的中央委员会表示，阮日光已辞去一切职务。他的“违规和缺点”给党的声誉留下了“污点”。现任副总统、少见的女性高层领导者方安修目前代理职务。自此以后，再无阮日光的消息。

Mr Thuong, in his early 50s, was the youngest-ever president. A propaganda whizz, he thought he was going places. He succeeded Nguyen Xuan Phuc, who resigned in January last year after taking responsibility for a scam involving pandemic testing kits (he insists neither he nor his family were involved). Mr Thuong relished his public role. But a planned visit to Vietnam by the king and queen of the Netherlands was abruptly cancelled at Vietnam’s request. Then, on March 20th, the party’s central committee said Mr Thuong had resigned from all posts. His “violations and shortcomings” had left “a bad mark” on the party’s reputation. The vice-president, Vo Thi Anh Xuan, a rare woman in the upper echelons, is standing in for now. Mr Thuong has not been heard of since.

可以确定，总统仅是四个关键职位之一。权力通常分散在四个“支柱”之间：党的总书记（最重要的职位）、总理（领导政府）、总统和全国代表大会主席。目前的总书记是阮富仲。他自2011年以来一直担任这个职位，是一个例外。他快80岁了，几乎可以确定他将在2026年的下次党代表大会上卸任——如果传言中的健康问题允许他坚持那么久。在幕后要闹出什么波澜，必须从接替他的人选背景中来看。

To be sure, the presidency is only one of four key positions. Authority is usually spread among four “pillars”: the general secretary of the party (the most important post), the prime minister (running the government), the president and the speaker of the National Assembly. The current general secretary is Nguyen Phu Trong. He has, exceptionally, been in the post since 2011. He is nearly 80 and will surely step down at the next party congress in 2026—if rumoured ill health allows him that long. Any ructions behind the façade must be viewed in the context of who succeeds him.

阮富仲的主要信条是，党如果不积极打击日益蔓延的腐败，就无法生存。他的“烈焰炉”运动已经使多名部长、一名副总理以及一系列在胡志明市、河内和各省市的高级领导人落马。复杂的是，个别强大的党内人物利用阮富仲的运动作为争权斗争的借口。

Mr Trong’s key tenet is that the party cannot survive without going after widening corruption. His “blazing furnace” campaign had already floored ministers, a deputy prime minister and a string of senior leaders in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and the provinces. To complicate things, powerful party figures use Mr Trong’s campaign as a pretext to jockey for power.

阮日光是总书记的门生，但最终这并没有帮助他。据新加坡伊斯哈克研究所的黎香协透露，阮日光被指控的错误行为与他在2011年至2014年任职的广西省党书记时间有关。对当地开发商腐败的调查已经导致了一些省级官员被查处。负责反腐败运动的实权而野心勃勃的公安部长阿廉可能已参与推翻阮日光。可以肯定的是，阿廉将渴望为自己在2026年争夺最高职位做好铺垫。

Mr Thuong was a protégé of the general secretary’s—but in the end that did not help him. According to Le Hong Hiep of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, a research body in Singapore, Mr Thuong’s supposed wrongdoings relate to his time as party secretary of Quang Ngai province from 2011 to 2014. The investigation of corruption at a local developer has already brought down a handful of provincial officials. The powerful and ambitious minister for public security, To Lam, who is at the heart of the anti-corruption campaign, may have been involved in Mr Thuong’s fall. Certainly, Mr Lam will be keen to position himself for a grab at the top job in 2026.

包括波音和Meta在内的60家美国企业代表团刚刚访问了这个国家。对于那些对越南发展抱有兴趣的人，阮日光的倒台带来了一个难题。一方面，这证实了腐败的影响已经扩及党内最高层。如果以目前正在审理的有关胡志明市股份有限银行120亿美元诈骗案为例，腐败的程度之深可见一斑。被指控被骗的金额超过了臭名昭著的1MDB马来西亚破产主权基金的两倍有余。

A delegation of 60 American businesses, including Boeing and Meta, has just been in the country. To those and others with an interest in Vietnam’s development, Mr Thuong’s fall presents a conundrum. On the one hand it confirms that the effects of corruption reach to the very top of the party. The national extent of corruption is huge, if the trial under way of an alleged fraud of $12bn at the Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank is any measure. The amount alleged to have been bilked is well over twice the notorious fraud at 1MDB, Malaysia’s now-insolvent sovereign fund.

对于那些把所有商业赌注都押在中国身上的人来说，越南作为一个应对中美大国竞争时代的避险工具的不确定性就在这里。去年，外国直接投资涌入越南，增长超过三分之一，达到366亿美元。

That is one uncertainty for those who have turned to Vietnam as a hedge against putting all business bets on China in an age of great-power rivalry between China and America. Annual foreign direct investment has been flooding in to Vietnam, rising by over a third last year, to $36.6bn.

另一方面，跨国公司知道如何在有点腐败的经济环境中航行。腐败虽然成本高昂，但可以通过促成交易来润滑商业运作。此外，在越南，外国投资的制造业部门要比由国家主导的领域更少受到腐败困扰。

On the other hand, multinationals know how to navigate somewhat corrupt economies. Corruption, for all its costs, can grease the wheels of commerce by getting deals done. Besides, in Vietnam the foreign-invested manufacturing sector is much less riven with graft than are state-directed sectors.

更糟糕的是，分析人士称，改革停滞了，因为害怕“烈焰炉”也会对自己进行清算的官员缺少进一步开放经济和鼓励投资的勇气。阮富仲曾表示，在确保稳定的同时打击腐败就像“在不打破罐子的情况下捉老鼠”。老鼠正在被抓，但罐子能否保持完整呢？越南将很快得到答案。 ■

Worse is when reform stalls—and that, analysts say, is happening now, as officials terrified that the blazing furnace will come for them lack the nerve to open up the economy further and encourage investment. Mr Trong once said that going after corruption while ensuring stability was like “catching a rat without breaking the pot”. Rats are being caught, but can the pot remain intact? Vietnam is about to find out. ■

**没有**政府正式承认阿富汗塔利班政权，部分原因是因为其对**女性教育**的限制是世界上最压迫性的。然而，即使对于塔利班来说，他们也还不够**激进**，无法与在2014年在伊拉克和叙利亚建立了“哈里发国”的伊斯兰国哈拉萨省（ISKP）相提并论。ISKP的宣传者 **抨击** 塔利班是对西方的出卖，因为他们与非伊斯兰国家的外交官进行会晤，并允许**不信道者**提供援助。

No government formally recognises the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, partly because its restrictions on female education are the world’s most oppressive. Yet even the Taliban are not radical enough for the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), an offshoot in Afghanistan of the group that established a “caliphate” in Iraq and Syria in 2014. ISKP propagandists rubbish the Taliban as sell-outs to the West because, among other sins, they meet non-Islamic diplomats and allow unbelievers to supply aid.

在其九年存在期间，ISKP主要袭击了阿富汗人。该组织的全球野心于3月22日显现，当时至少四名枪手在莫斯科的一场音乐会上杀害了139人。美国官员指责ISKP为这次袭击负责；俄罗斯随后逮捕了来自塔吉克斯坦的嫌疑人。如果指控属实，这将突显该组织在阿富汗之外发动袭击的记录不断扩大。它招致了一个长列表的敌人，包括美国和中国。今年1月，它的新兵袭击了土耳其的一座教堂，并实施了数十年来伊朗的最致命恐怖袭击。两名嫌犯在前往俄罗斯之前曾在土耳其逗留。土耳其政府表示已经进行了一波逮捕行动。

During its nine-year existence, ISKP has mainly killed Afghans. The group’s global ambitions burst into view on March 22nd, when at least four gunmen killed 139 people at a concert in Moscow. American officials blamed ISKP for the attack; Russia later arrested suspects from Tajikistan. If the charges are proved they will underscore the group’s expanding record of strikes beyond Afghanistan. It cultivates a long list of enemies, including America and China. In January its recruits hit a church in Turkey and carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in Iran in decades. Two of the suspects spent time in Turkey before travelling to Russia. The Turkish government says that it has made a wave of arrests.

俄罗斯成为ISKP瞄准的对象，因为它在喀布尔设有大使馆，并在莫斯科接受了塔利班的军事武官。俄罗斯还向叙利亚提供援助，叙利亚巴沙尔•阿萨德政权曾协助解体ISKP的母组织。对莫斯科的袭击也可能反映了ISKP在塔吉克斯坦、乌兹别克斯坦和哈萨克斯坦等地的招募情况。该组织的自有媒体机构al-Azaim用中亚语言发布内容。根据联合国的说法，直到去年被逮捕，塔吉克斯坦激进分子Abu Miskin是该组织中“最活跃的宣传者和高级招募人员”之一。

Russia is in ISKP’s crosshairs because it maintains an embassy in Kabul and has accepted a Taliban military attaché in Moscow. It also provides aid to Syria, where Bashar al-Assad’s regime helped dismantle ISKP’s parent organisation. The attack in Moscow may also reflect ISKP’s recruiting among Tajiks, Uzbeks and Kazakhs. The group’s in-house media arm, al-Azaim, distributes content in Central Asian languages. Until his arrest last year, Abu Miskin, a Tajik militant, was among its “most active propagandists and high-ranking recruiters”, according to the UN.

对于ISKP的实力估计不一，从不到2,000到5,000不等。塔利班的进攻夺回了ISKP曾经在阿富汗占领的领土。伊斯兰堡组织Khorasan Diary的研究主任Riccardo Valle称，ISKP如今的实力在于“它能找到并联系到少数受挫的人”。据信目前的领导人是阿拉伯裔、29岁的Shahab al-Muhajir。他鲜少发声，但可以肯定的是，他所领导的松散组织如今将处于全球关注的中心。■

Estimates of the ISKP’s strength vary from fewer than 2,000 to 5,000. Taliban offensives have taken back territory the group once held in Afghanistan. According to Riccardo Valle, director of research at Khorasan Diary, an Islamabad-based group, ISKP’s strength these days is “its ability to find and connect with small numbers of disaffected people”. The current leader is believed to be Shahab al-Muhajir, a 29-year-old of Arab descent. He is rarely heard from, but he can be certain that his disparate organisation will now be at the centre of global attention. ■

博物馆门票价格逐渐上涨 (Museums are becoming more expensive)
==============================================

这会扼杀未来的赞助和观众吗？ (Will it kill off future patronage and attendance?)
---------------------------------------------------------------

![游客排队进入巴黎卢浮宫。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_CUP503.jpg)

“**博物馆**几乎应该是免费的道德责任，”现代艺术博物馆（MoMA）馆长格伦·洛瑞说。那是在2002年，当时MoMA的门票价格为12美元（按照今天的物价大约为19美元）。今年10月，MoMA开始收取30美元的门票费，这是一系列票价上涨的最新案例。

“It’s almost a moral duty that museums should be free,” said Glenn Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). That was in 2002, when a ticket to MoMA cost $12 (around $19 in today’s prices). In October MoMA started charging $30, the latest in a series of price rises.

MoMA并非唯一一家提高门票价格的博物馆。纽约的[大都会博物馆](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2020/04/13/a-sober-sesquicentennial-for-the-met-museum)于2018年终止了针对外地游客的长期“随你意愿付费”政策，并于2022年将他们的常规门票价格提高至30美元。去年夏天，旧金山现代艺术博物馆、费城艺术博物馆、惠特尼博物馆和古根海姆博物馆也纷纷效仿，将标准票价从25美元调涨至30美元。

MoMA is not the only museum raising the cost of admission. The [Metropolitan Museum](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2020/04/13/a-sober-sesquicentennial-for-the-met-museum) in New York ended its longstanding “pay what you will” policy for out-of-town visitors in 2018 and raised general admission for them to $30 in 2022. Last summer the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum and the Guggenheim Museum all followed suit, bumping a standard ticket from $25 to $30.

博物馆工作人员抱怨成本不断攀升，以及“长期症候群”的困扰。在美国，仅有三分之一的博物馆达到或超过疫情前的游客人数。在欧洲，能源和劳动力成本的上升也推高了门票价格。今年1月，柏林国立博物馆、卢浮宫和梵蒂冈博物馆（含西斯廷礼拜堂）将常规门票价格分别上调了20%、29%和17%。仅有[亚洲](https://www.economist.com/china/2021/06/10/china-says-it-will-be-a-museum-power-by-2035)和中东地区的博物馆票价保持稳定，那里的博物馆更年轻，国家资助特别慷慨。

Museum staff complain of climbing costs and a case of “long covid”. In America only a third of museums have met or surpassed pre-pandemic visitor numbers. Higher energy and labour costs have pushed up ticket prices in Europe, too. In January the Berlin State Museums, the Louvre and the Vatican Museums, which include the Sistine Chapel, raised the price of general-admission tickets by 20%, 29% and 17%, respectively. Prices have remained stable only in [Asia](https://www.economist.com/china/2021/06/10/china-says-it-will-be-a-museum-power-by-2035) and the Middle East, where museums are younger and state funding is especially generous.

门票价格可能看起来很高，特别是在旅游胜地城市，游客不太可能因为多花几美元而被阻止。但是“无论博物馆收取多少门票费，都无法覆盖它们的运营成本，”咨询公司劳德文化资源的主管哈维尔·希门内斯说。2018年，美国艺术博物馆协会报告称，门票销售平均仅占美国艺术博物馆总收入的7%。会员费贡献了另外7%。其余预算通常来自捐款基金、慈善捐款、政府拨款和零售业务。

Ticket fees may seem high, particularly in destination cities where tourists are not likely to be dissuaded by spending a few more dollars. But “whatever museums charge, it is not covering their operating costs,” says Javier Jimenez, a director at Lord Cultural Resources, a consulting firm. The Association of Art Museum Directors reported in 2018 that ticket sales accounted on average for just 7% of total revenue at American art museums. Memberships contributed another 7%. The remainder of budgets usually come from endowments, charitable donations, grants and retail operations.

欧洲的博物馆不那么依赖门票收入，因为它们通常得到政府的[大量补贴](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/07/06/governments-are-using-culture-to-spur-economic-regeneration)。这让要求纳税人购买昂贵门票、实际上是“双重买单”的做法难以开口。许多机构选择为年轻人、退休人士和本地居民提供优惠。

European museums are less reliant on admissions fees, because they are often [heavily subsidised](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/07/06/governments-are-using-culture-to-spur-economic-regeneration) by governments. This can make it awkward to ask taxpayers to buy a pricey ticket and in effect pay twice. Many institutions choose to offer reductions for the young, pensioners and locals.

英国的所有国家机构提供免费入场，中国大多数由国家运营的博物馆也是如此（特别展览除外）。在美国，有约30%的博物馆是免费的，包括史密森尼博物馆等大型公共博物馆和洛杉矶盖蒂中心等私人博物馆。一些观察家重复了洛瑞先生的号召，尤其是那些最富裕的博物馆，应完全停止收取门票。

All national institutions in Britain offer free admission, as do most state-run museums in China. (Exceptions are made for special exhibitions.) In America some 30% are free, including big public museums like those of the Smithsonian Institution and private ones such as the Getty Centre in Los Angeles. Some observers have repeated Mr Lowry’s call for museums, especially the most well-endowed, to stop charging for admission entirely.

门票价格的激增与博物馆向更多多样化公众分享艺术的目标相悖。这也可能加快美国参观博物馆和美术馆的人数下降速度：2017年至2022年间减少了26%。

Ballooning prices go against museums’ goal of sharing art with a more diverse public. They could also accelerate the already steep decline in the share of Americans attending museums and galleries: between 2017 and 2022 it shrunk by 26%.

公众兴趣下降，尤其是年轻人的兴趣，对于严重依赖公共支持的机构而言是一大挑战。今天选择不参观博物馆的人，有可能会在未来几年反对政府补贴或拒绝以资助者身份提供私人支票。在博物馆的画廊里花时间的人更有可能领会其丰富之处，并希望为其投资。

Declining public interest, particularly among young people, is a challenge for institutions that rely heavily on public support. Those who choose not to visit a museum today may be the people who vote against government subsidies or refuse to write personal cheques as patrons in a few years. Those who spend time inside museums’ galleries are more likely to grasp their richness and want to invest their own riches in them.

然而，显著降低成本可能并不会很大程度上吸引新的观众。在美国和欧洲，人们表示价格只是在决定闲暇时间做什么时的一个因素。印第安纳大学的经济学家迈克尔·拉什顿称，如果门票免费，“通常来的人会更频繁地前来。否则，你并没有真正改变你的受众群体。”他将博物馆比作[美国精英大学](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/03/21/a-new-book-rebukes-the-luxury-beliefs-of-americas-upper-class)：哈佛和斯坦福可以负担起为所有人提供免费学费，但许多无需这份恩惠的富裕学生将是最大的受益者。在西方世界各地的博物馆辩论着合适的价格时，大多数不太可能得出答案是零，无论是否有“道德责任”。■

Yet significantly reducing costs may not actually do much to attract new audiences either. In both America and Europe, people say that price is just one of several factors when it comes to deciding what to do with their leisure time. If tickets were free, “people who typically come anyway might come more often. Otherwise, you’re not really changing your demographic,” says Michael Rushton, an economist at Indiana University who studies pricing in the arts. He compares museums to [elite American universities](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/03/21/a-new-book-rebukes-the-luxury-beliefs-of-americas-upper-class): Harvard and Stanford could afford to make tuition free for all, but many wealthy students who do not need the gift would be among the biggest beneficiaries. As museums throughout the West debate what price is right, most are unlikely to conclude the answer is zero, “moral duty” or not. ■

碧昂斯的乡村转变背后隐藏着什么？ (What lies behind Beyoncé’s country turn?)
========================================================

这位明星歌手一直是音乐潮流的精明解读者。 (The star singer has always been a canny interpreter of musical trends)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![碧昂斯戴着牛仔帽，观看第66届格莱美奖。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_CUP001.jpg)

在**BEYONCÉ**发布二月的乡村流行曲《**Texas Hold ’Em**》之前，她早已展示了她的牌面。2021年，她推出了一款灵感来源于“美国黑人牛仔被忽视的历史”的服装系列。她还在[《**Renaissance**》](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/08/01/renaissance-is-a-clever-crowd-pleasing-pop-album)（2022年）专辑封面上骑在一匹水晶马上，并在格莱美奖上戴着白色宽檐帽。她的歌词经常提及她在休斯敦的成长。“《**Formation**》中她唱道，“挣了这么多钱，但他们永远无法剥夺她的国家归属”。

BEYONCÉ had shown her cards long before she released “Texas Hold ’Em”, a country-pop track, in February. In 2021 she launched a clothing collection inspired by the “overlooked history of the American black cowboy”. She sat astride a crystal horse for the album cover of [“Renaissance”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/08/01/renaissance-is-a-clever-crowd-pleasing-pop-album) (2022) and wore a white, wide-brimmed hat to the Grammy awards. Her lyrics have frequently referred to her upbringing in Houston. “Earned all this money,” she sang on “Formation” in 2016, “but they never take the country out” of her.

她的新专辑《**Cowboy Carter**》于3月29日发布，唤起了一种乡村音乐的氛围。这张唱片是在疫情期间构思的三部曲项目的第二部分，其中碧昂斯向音乐流派的黑人根源致敬。 （在《**Renaissance**》中，她专注于迪斯科和深浅音乐。）

Her new album, “Cowboy Carter”, released on March 29th, evokes a honky-tonk. The record is the second instalment in a three-part project conceived during the covid-19 pandemic, in which Beyoncé pays tribute to the black roots of musical genres. (On “Renaissance” she focused on disco and house music.)

这张专辑的发布时间正如一场排舞一样恰到好处：美国乡村文化在流行文化中蓬勃发展。模特们穿着蛇皮牛仔靴走在路易威登的T台上，普拉达在销售绳索领结。像《**黄石**》这样的西部史诗吸引了数百万观众。去年，[乡村音乐曲目](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/09/01/thanks-to-morgan-wallen-country-musics-popularity-has-surged)在Spotify美国前50首歌曲流媒体中所占比例超过三分之一，从2016年的2%上升。

The album is as perfectly timed as a line dance: Americana is flourishing in popular culture. Models have been strutting down Louis Vuitton’s catwalk wearing snakeskin cowboy boots, and Prada is selling bolo ties. Western sagas such as “Yellowstone” have drawn millions of viewers. Last year [country-music tracks](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/09/01/thanks-to-morgan-wallen-country-musics-popularity-has-surged) accounted for more than a third of streams of the top 50 songs on Spotify in America, up from 2% in 2016.

碧昂斯尝试乡村音乐是艺术家跨越新曲风以寻找新观众的传统的一部分。[鲍勃·迪伦](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/10/13/folk-music-traces-bob-dylans-life-through-seven-songs)放弃了声乐民谣转向电气摇滚（并因此被称为“卖国贼”）。[大卫·鲍伊](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2016/01/16/starman-jones)尝试过各种造型，并创作出搭配的不同音乐。多莉·帕顿、[泰勒·斯威夫特](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/02/06/the-meaning-of-the-hysteria-over-taylor-swift)和[仙妮亚·特温](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/02/03/shania-twain-took-country-music-to-the-world)都将乡村音乐抛在脑后，转向主流流行音乐。Coldplay摆脱了早期专辑中有时沉闷的独立摇滚，转向更欢快的流行和电子音乐。

Beyoncé’s experimentation with country is part of a tradition of artists crossing into new genres in search of new audiences. [Bob Dylan](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/10/13/folk-music-traces-bob-dylans-life-through-seven-songs) forsook acoustic folk for electrified rock (and was called a “Judas” for his efforts). [David Bowie](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2016/01/16/starman-jones) tried on a wardrobe of looks and produced different sounds to match. Dolly Parton, [Taylor Swift](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/02/06/the-meaning-of-the-hysteria-over-taylor-swift) and [Shania Twain](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/02/03/shania-twain-took-country-music-to-the-world) all left country behind for mainstream pop. Coldplay have moved away from the sometimes dour indie rock of their early albums for more upbeat pop and electronic tunes.

那些适应新音乐潮流的人蓬勃发展。Coldplay和斯威夫特女士都正处于利润丰厚的巡回演出中—据估计，两者分别带来了8.1亿美元和10亿美元的收入，而许多同龄人已经隐没在黑暗中。

Those who adapt to new musical trends thrive. Coldplay and Ms Swift are in the midst of lucrative concert tours—which have brought in an estimated $810m and $1bn, respectively—while many of their contemporaries have faded into obscurity.

碧昂斯也在不断发展以满足变化的口味。在20世纪90年代，作为女子乐团“命运女孩”的主唱，她演唱了一些鼓舞人心的女性赋权歌曲。独自一人后，她将富有感染力的抒情歌曲加入她的曲目中展示她强大的嗓音，后来又融入了雷鬼和陷阱音乐。

Beyoncé has also evolved to meet changing tastes. In the 1990s, as the lead singer of Destiny’s Child, a girl band, she sang rousing anthems of female empowerment. After striking out on her own, she added soulful ballads to her repertoire to show off her powerful voice and later incorporated reggae and trap.

乡村音乐使碧昂斯再次尝试一种新的写作风格。在早期的R&B热门曲目中，她夸口拥有太多花费的钱。相比之下，在新的乡村音乐曲目《**16辆马车**》中，碧昂斯的歌词更接地气：她回忆起早期职业生涯的辛劳和“过度工作和压力过大”。在情绪上，这些歌曲更适合通货膨胀和生活成本危机的时代。

Country allows Beyoncé to experiment with a new style of songwriting again. On early R&B hits she bragged of having too much money to spend. By contrast, on “16 Carriages”, one of the new country tracks, Beyoncé’s lyrics are more down-to-earth: she remembers the toil of her early career and being “overworked and overwhelmed”. Tonally, these songs are better suited to an era of inflation and cost-of-living crises.

除了作为明智的商业选择之外，跨界还使艺术家能够对自己的价值做出立场表态。例如，Lady Gaga是一位流行音乐制作人，选择发布一张爵士标准曲目专辑来证明她的声乐实力。有广度历来很重要。20世纪初，当唱片公司根据种族界限制制作和推广音乐时，尝试成为一种方式，让像[路易斯·阿姆斯特朗](https://www.economist.com/review/1997/09/04/beloved-satchmo)这样的黑人艺术家“断然表示不能被简单归类为一种刻板形象”，音乐历史学家埃里克·韦斯巴德说。通过将才能投入各种曲风，碧昂斯表明她在艺术上“没有限制”，他补充道。

As well as being an astute commercial choice, crossing over allows artists to make a statement about their own value. Lady Gaga, for instance, was a pop hitmaker and chose to release an album of jazz standards to prove her vocal chops. Having range has long been important. In the early 20th century, when record labels made and marketed music along racial lines, experimentation became a way for black artists such as [Louis Armstrong](https://www.economist.com/review/1997/09/04/beloved-satchmo) to “assert that no one should reduce them to a stereotype”, says Eric Weisbard, a music historian. By turning her talents to a host of genres, Beyoncé is showing that she has “no limit artistically”, he adds.

《**Texas Hold ’Em**》在美国和英国排行榜上名列前茅。但有人质疑碧昂斯的曲目是否真正是正宗的乡村音乐。一个乡村电台甚至拒绝播放该曲。在这个白人为主的音乐流派中，这是一个敏感的话题，这一流派诞生于100年前，起源于非裔美国民间音乐。碧昂斯希望她的作品将有助于“消除提及艺术家种族与音乐流派发布之间的关系”。她发布了一张她骑在另一匹马上的照片，宣称：“这不是一张乡村专辑。这是一张碧昂斯的专辑。” ■

“Texas Hold ’Em” has been at the top of the charts in America and Britain. But some have questioned whether Beyoncé’s tracks are authentic country music. One country radio station even refused to play it. This is a fraught subject in a heavily white genre, which originated 100 years ago and has roots in African-American folk music. Beyoncé hopes her work will help to nullify “the mention of an artist’s race, as it relates to releasing genres of music”. Posting an image of her on yet another horse, she declared: “This ain’t a country album. This is a Beyoncé album.” ■

你的婚姻能经得起一次船难吗? (Could your marriage survive a shipwreck?)
======================================================

一本关于一对在海上滞留近四个月的夫妻的新书《莫里斯和玛拉琳》，让你深思 (“Maurice and Maralyn”, a new book about a couple stranded almost four months at sea, makes you wonder)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![毛里斯和玛拉琳·贝利与他们的木筏。](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_CUP506.jpg)

**毛里斯和玛拉琳**。作者：Sophie Elmhirst。*Chatto & Windus；272页；£18.99*

**Maurice and Maralyn.** By Sophie Elmhirst. *Chatto & Windus; 272 pages; £18.99*

1973年6月，一艘韩国金枪鱼捕捞船的船长首次注意到毛里斯和玛拉琳·贝利漂浮在太平洋上时，他无法弄清他们是什么。大约四个月前，当他们试图从英国航行到新西兰时，他们的船撞到了一头抹香鲸。这对夫妇被困在一只绑着脆弱小船的小充气救生筏上，靠雨水、割破海龟喉咙、勒死鸟和窒息鲨鱼维持生活。他们无法站起来，身穿已经破碎的衣服，骨骼看起来随时可能裂穿皮肤。

When the captain of a Korean tuna-fishing ship first caught sight of Maurice and Maralyn Bailey bobbing in the Pacific Ocean in June 1973, he could not work out what they were. About four months earlier, while they were trying to sail from England to New Zealand, their boat had [crashed](https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/02/27/explaining-history-through-numerical-groupings-is-in-vogue) into a sperm whale. The couple was stranded in a tiny inflatable life-raft tied to a flimsy dinghy, subsisting on rainwater, turtles whose throats they had slit, birds they strangled and sharks they suffocated. Unable to stand and wearing clothes that had disintegrated, their skeletons looked ready to burst through their skin.

奇迹般地，他们还活着。在《毛里斯和玛拉琳》中，Sophie Elmhirst（《1843》杂志的定期撰稿人，《经济学人》的姊妹杂志）依据自己的报道、玛拉琳的日记、两人出版的回忆录以及大量新闻剪报，讲述了这对夫妇生存的故事，以及伴随而来的爱情故事。

Miraculously, they were alive. In “Maurice and Maralyn”, Sophie Elmhirst (an occasional contributor to [*1843*](https://www.economist.com/1843), *The Economist*’s sister magazine) draws on her own reporting, Maralyn’s diaries, the memoirs that the two published and a trove of news clips to tell the tale of this couple’s survival—and the love story that bubbled alongside.

这对夫妇（如图所示）在十年前于英格兰德比的一次汽车拉力赛上相遇。毛里斯年长，驾驶飞机，但孤独、笨拙，感觉自己“在做任何事情之前还有很多要克服”。玛拉琳健谈、勇敢，与毛里斯不同，“似乎本能地知道如何去做事情”。他们结婚，买了一栋房子，然后卖掉它，用这笔钱购买了一艘游艇。他们的梦想是成为探险家。

The pair (pictured) had met a decade earlier at a car rally in Derby, England. Maurice was older and flew planes, but was lonely, awkward and felt that he had “so much to wade through before he could *do*anything”. Maralyn was chatty and brave and, unlike Maurice, “seemed to know instinctively how to *do*things”. They married, bought a home and then sold it, using the money to buy a yacht. Their dream was to become explorers.

他们找到了自己的冒险。但在《毛里斯和玛拉琳》中，尽管有航海和肾上腺素，但爱本身却是使生活非凡的“一种可怕的偶然”。两个人选择并被选择，“最不可思议的是，这些选择必须大致在同一时间发生”，Elmhirst女士写道。

They found their adventure. But despite the [seafaring](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/09/14/a-history-of-solitary-sailing-asks-why-people-seek-out-its-danger) and adrenaline, in “Maurice and Maralyn” it is love itself, “a terrifying fluke”, which makes life extraordinary. Two people choose and are chosen, “and, most unlikely of all, these choices must happen at roughly the same time”, Ms Elmhirst writes.

心碎发生在漂流后。年老、疾病袭来，孤独回归。然而最后，毛里斯宣布他的一生是成功的。并非因为任何开拓性的探险或有关他们非凡生存的头条新闻，而只是因为他曾经爱过并被爱过。这个故事从未感伤，节奏恰到好处，这是最好的故事类型：一个真实的故事。■

The heartbreak comes later, long after the shipwreck. The pair age, illness strikes, loneliness returns. In the end, though, Maurice declares his life a triumph. Not because of any pioneering expedition or headlines about their extraordinary survival, but simply because he has loved and been loved. Never sentimental and perfectly paced, this is the best sort of story: a true one.■



<hr><span style="color: red;"><b>文化 | 野兽的国度</b></span> (Culture | Where the wild thing is)

“格鲁法罗”的全球化之路 (How “The Gruffalo” went global)
==========================================

这本儿童图书，首次出版已有25年，并重新定义了成功的规则。 (The children’s book, first published 25 years ago, rewrote the rules for success)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![An illustration from The Gruffalo book.](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_CUP003.jpg)

当朱莉娅·唐纳森打算写一个儿童书籍，讲述一只**老鼠**穿越“深邃的黑暗森林”，机智地应对一系列捕食者的故事时，她本意是让他碰到一只普通**老虎**。唐纳森女士是一位英国作家，曾为儿童电视节目写歌曲，她受到一个关于一个女孩通过说服**老虎**自己是森林女王而逃脱死亡的中国寓言的启发。但问题是：唐纳森女士希望这本书用押韵的对句写成，而没有太多的单词与**老虎**押韵。她决定让怪兽的名字以“oh”结尾会更为得当。因此，在德国插画家阿克塞尔·舍夫勒的帮助下，儿童出版界中最赚钱的怪物之一诞生了。

When Julia Donaldson set out to write a children’s book featuring a mouse—who would take a stroll through “the deep dark wood”, fending off a series of predators with wit and cunning—she intended him to meet a [tiger for tea](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2019/06/08/obituary-judith-kerr-died-on-may-23rd). Ms Donaldson, a British author who wrote songs for children’s television, had been inspired by a Chinese fable about a girl who escapes death by convincing a tiger that she is the queen of the forest. But there was a problem: Ms Donaldson wanted the book to be in rhyming couplets, and not a lot rhymes with tiger. She decided it would be more pragmatic for the beast’s name to end with the sound “oh”. And so, with the help of Axel Scheffler, a German illustrator, one of the most lucrative monsters in children’s publishing was born.

《格鲁法洛》于25年前的三月出版，取得了极大的成功，以至于疲倦的家长们无论何时都考虑辞掉他们无聊的工作去写儿童书籍。据出版商称，迄今为止它在全球销售了1160万册。去年，唐纳森女士的全部作品——目前已达200本且不断增加——创下了1560万英镑（1960万美元）的销售额，《格鲁法洛》领先其他作品。

“The Gruffalo”, which was published 25 years ago in March, has achieved such great success that tired parents everywhere have considered jacking in their boring jobs to write children’s books.To date it has sold 11.6m copies worldwide, according to the publisher. Last year Ms Donaldson’s whole oeuvre—now 200 books and counting—brought in £15.6m ($19.6m) in sales, with “The Gruffalo” leading the pack.

虽然有些书籍让成年人心中暗自叹息当孩子在晚上挑选它们阅读，但《格鲁法洛》读起来几乎和听起来一样有趣。像大多数关于动物的寓言故事一样，这个故事的背景不具体，主题普遍，描绘了弱者的胜利，智取力量的主题，这使得它能引起年轻和老年观众的共鸣。同时，值得称道的是舍夫勒，一个插画家，他的风格如此令人熟知，自与[罗尔德·达尔](https://www.economist.com/1843/2014/07/30/roald-dahl)合作以来，一直如此。舍夫勒表示最初的素描“被编辑认为对幼儿来说‘太吓人了’，所以我必须将它做得更圆润和更‘可亲’”。结果使得该怪物看起来像莫里斯·森达克的《狂野王国》（1963）中的一个可怕角色，另一本经典之作。

Whereas some books cause grown-ups to groan inwardly when a child selects them at bedtime, “The Gruffalo” is almost as fun to read aloud as it is to listen to. Like most fables featuring animals, it has an unspecific setting and universal themes—the triumph of the underdog, brains over brawn—that help it resonate with both young and old audiences. Credit is also owed to Mr Scheffler, an illustrator with the most recognisable style since Quentin Blake (who collaborated with [Roald Dahl](https://www.economist.com/1843/2014/07/30/roald-dahl)). Mr Scheffler has said initial sketches “were deemed to be ‘too scary for tiny children’ by the editor so I had to make him a bit rounder and more ‘cuddly’.” The result resembles one of the terrible creatures from Maurice Sendak’s “Where the Wild Things Are” (1963), another classic.

如今，你可以购买“格鲁法洛”品牌的拖鞋、靠垫和薯片（有乳酪洋葱味格鲁法洛爪，有人要吗？）；观看舞台剧；并让一个蹒跚学步的幼儿安静半个小时，在获奥斯卡奖的短片中，由詹姆斯·科登和罗比·科尔特兰配音。很多粉丝认为这本书的续集《格鲁法洛的孩子》——就像《教父2》和[“壮志凌云：狗迅”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/05/26/top-gun-maverick-feels-the-need-to-speed-into-the-past)一样——比原作更精彩。

Today you can buy Gruffalo-branded slippers, cushions and crisps (cheese-and-onion Gruffalo claws, anyone?); get tickets to the stage show; and keep a toddler quiet for half an hour with the Oscar-winning short film featuring the voices of James Corden and Robbie Coltrane. Many fans think that the book’s sequel, “The Gruffalo’s Child”, is—like “The Godfather Part II” and [“Top Gun: Maverick”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/05/26/top-gun-maverick-feels-the-need-to-speed-into-the-past)—even better than the original.

据统计，“格鲁法洛”已经被翻译成107种语言和方言，包括亚美尼亚语、巴斯克语、世界语、库尔德语和泰语，使其成为近代翻译最多的儿童读物之一。英国《麦克米伦儿童图书》的版权总监米歇尔·杨表示，只有安托万·德·圣埃克苏佩里于1943年首次出版的《小王子》拥有更多的外文版本。

At the last count “The Gruffalo” has appeared in 107 languages and dialects, including Armenian, Basque, Esperanto,Kurdish and Thai, making it the second-most translated children’s book of recent times. Only “The Little Prince” by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, first published in 1943, has racked up more foreign editions, says Michele Young, rights director at Macmillan Children’s Books, the publisher of “The Gruffalo” in Britain.

因为如今它的名声似乎是板上钉钉的，很容易忘记这本书最初是违背了早期期望的。根据杨女士的说法，在唐纳森女士“打开了先驱之路”之前，编辑们对押韵的书籍感到不安。将权利卖给国际出版商很困难，因为诗歌传译起来一直都是非常困难的。

Because its fame now seems like a foregone conclusion, it is easy to forget that the book defied early expectations. Before Ms Donaldson “paved the way” for other authors, editors were nervous about books that rhymed, according to Ms Young. It was hard to sell the rights to international publishers, because poetry is notoriously difficult to translate.

弗拉基米尔·纳博科夫认为翻译押韵是如此具有挑战性，以至于作家们应该不要费心了。在他将[亚历山大·普希金](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/06/04/for-alexander-pushkin-lockdown-was-liberating)的俄罗斯韵文翻译成英文散文的《尤金妮·奥涅金》的序言中，这位小说家明确了他的信念，即译者应尽可能忠实于原文。“复制韵律，但又要英译整首诗，这在数学上是不可能的。”他写道。令人欣慰的是，大多数《格鲁法洛》的翻译者无视了纳博科夫的请求。他们选择效仿亚历山大·蒲柏等诗人，后者翻译了荷马的《伊利亚特》，捕捉了原作的精神，而不是力求逼真。

Vladimir Nabokov thought translating rhyme was so challenging that writers should not bother. In the introduction to his translation of “Eugene Onegin”, which rendered [Alexander Pushkin](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/06/04/for-alexander-pushkin-lockdown-was-liberating)’s Russian verse into English prose, the novelist spelt out his belief that translators should be as faithful to the original text as possible. “To reproduce the rhymes and yet translate the entire poem literally is mathematically impossible,” he wrote. Happily for children and parents who do not speak English, most translators of “The Gruffalo” ignored Nabokov’s pleas. Instead they have chosen to channel poets such as Alexander Pope, whose translation of Homer’s “Iliad” captures the spirit of the original rather than striving for verisimilitude.

安迪·斯马特与他的妻子纳迪亚·福达合作将《格鲁法洛》翻译成阿拉伯语，他们概括了自己的工作原则：“保持情绪，保持押韵，不要失去幽默感。”他们的版本将插图翻转，使之可以从右到左阅读，是为数不多其中之一将**格鲁法洛**的名字改变的版本：“*格尔夫*”，这是一个虚构的单词，借鉴了“食尸鬼”，因为在阿拉伯语中更容易押韵。

Andy Smart, who translated “The Gruffalo” into Arabic with his wife, Nadia Fouda, distilled the pair’s modus operandi to: “Keep the mood, keep the rhyme, don’t lose the humour.” Their version, in which the pictures have been flipped so it can be read from right to left, is one of the few to change the name of the Gruffalo: to “*Gharfoul*”, a made-up word drawing on “ghoul”, because it was easier to rhyme in Arabic.

为了让行文具有押韵与尽量保持原文质感，再加上译者希望为文本增添自己的特色，导致了一些令人愉悦的变化。在英文原版中，唐纳森女士的最后一句是“老鼠找到了坚果，这坚果很美味”，而意大利版**老鼠**则得到了一个结束性的独白：“嗯，这味道不错。多美好的一天！生活多美好！”。

The need to make lines rhyme and scan, coupled with a translator’s desire to give their own spin to the text, leads to delightful variations. Whereas Ms Donaldson’s last line in the original English is “The mouse found a nut and the nut was good”, the Italian mouse gets a closing soliloquy: “Mmmh, è squisita! Che bella giornata! Che dolce è la vita!” (“Mmm, it’s delicious. What a beautiful day! How sweet life is!”).

《格鲁法洛》的鉴赏者可以很快发现**老鼠**所声称的格鲁法洛最喜欢的食物之间的差异，在成功吓跑捕食者的策略中。在德文版本中，“烤狐狸”变成了“Fuchsspieß”（狐狸串）。日文翻译家将“炒蛇”改成了“蛇 *kabayaki*”，参照传统烤鱼的一道菜，而在法文版中则成为了“蛇奶油”（“cream of snake”）。这些地方化的改编使得《格鲁法洛》成为睡前无论身在何处，都能尽兴的享受。■

Gruffalo connoisseurs can have fun spotting the differences between what the mouse claims are the Gruffalo’s favourite foods, in a successful ploy to scare off predators. In the German version, “roasted fox” becomes “Fuchsspieß” (fox kebab). The Japanese translator has turned “scrambled snake” into “snake *kabayaki*”, adapting a traditional dish of grilled fish, while in the French version it becomes “crème de serpent”(“cream of snake”). Such local adaptation makes “The Gruffalo” a perfect treatbefore bed, wherever you are. ■

**Enough.** By Luke Hildyard. *Pluto Press;* *160 pages; $19.95 and £14.99*

两本新书主张消灭富人。但并非波尔布特式地将他们全部杀掉，因为这两位作者——一位是荷兰伦理学教授，另一位是一家左翼英国智库的主任，都是极其友善的。相反，他们支持的是使个人拥有“过多”资金成为不可能的政策。

Two new books argue for doing away with the rich. Not in the Pol Pot sense of murdering them all, for the writers—a Dutch professor of ethics and the director of a left-wing British think-tank—are impeccably nice. Rather, they favour policies that would make it impossible to have “too much” money.

究竟是多少算太多？荷兰乌得勒支大学的Ingrid Robeyns，也就是《限制主义》的作者，认为政府应阻止任何人积累超过1000万美元（或英镑、欧元；这只是一个大概数）。除了这个强硬的“政治限制”，她认为还应该设立一个更低的“道德限制”。在那些由国家支付医疗和养老金的国家，没有人应该积累超过100万美元的储蓄，社会应该蔑视那些这样做的人。

How much is too much? Ingrid Robeyns of Utrecht University in the Netherlands, the author of “Limitarianism”, thinks the state should prevent anyone from accumulating more than $10m (or pounds, or euros; it is a rough figure). In addition to this hard “political limit”, she thinks there should be a much lower “ethical limit”. In countries where the state pays for health care and pensions, no one should amass more than $1m in savings, and society should scorn anyone who does.

Luke Hildyard是伦敦高薪中心的负责人，他的书名为“Enough”，他主张设立一种“绝对上限”，尽管没有提出具体数字。他认为没有人应该赚取超过当前进入最高1%纳税人榜单的门槛的收入。（在英国，这一门槛在2021-22年是超过18万英镑；在美国，2021年大约是33万美元）。他声称，重新分配额外收入或财富，或实行政策以避免这些财富一开始就积累，“没有真正的坏处”。

Luke Hildyard, who runs the High Pay Centre in London and whose book is called “Enough”, stops short of an “absolute cap” but suggests something close to it. No one should earn more than the current threshold for entering the top 1% of taxpayers, he believes. (In Britain that was over £180,000 a year in 2021-22; in America it was about $330,000 in 2021.) Redistributing additional income or wealth beyond this point, or enacting policies so that such riches never accrue in the first place, “has no real downsides”, he claims.

这两位作者提出[对富人的憎恶](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/01/29/davos-man-is-a-passionate-denunciation-of-the-mega-rich)有许多理由。随着他们拥有私人飞机和偶尔在太空度假，他们对环境有害。他们拥有多套房产，加剧了住房短缺问题。其中一些人购买政治影响力。有些人通过贪污腐败获取了财富。实际主义者可能会直接解决这些问题，通过对碳排放征税，允许建造更多的住房，加强竞选资金法律或打击腐败。但对于Robeyns女士和Hildyard先生来说，一切取决于削减富人的规模。

The authors offer many reasons for [loathing the loaded](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/01/29/davos-man-is-a-passionate-denunciation-of-the-mega-rich). They are bad for the environment, with their private jets and occasional holidays in space. They aggravate housing shortages by owning multiple homes. Some of them buy political influence. Some acquired their wealth corruptly. A pragmatist might tackle these problems directly, by taxing carbon emissions, allowing more homes to be built, tightening campaign-finance laws or cracking down on corruption. But for Ms Robeyns and Mr Hildyard, everything depends on cutting the rich down to size.

他们提出了合理的观点，即对于穷人来说，额外的1000美元的边际益处大于富人。一个饥饿的家庭可以用这笔钱买几个月的食物；而一位银行家可能会在一顿晚餐上花掉这笔钱，还不包括葡萄酒。但作者们进一步指出，上升的不平等导致了许多问题。他们辩称，一个更加平等的社会将会更少焦虑（没有论斗争！），更具凝聚力（更少羡慕！）。富人积累的钱可以用于帮助穷人并改善公共服务。

They make the reasonable point that the marginal benefit of an extra $1,000 is greater for the poor than the rich. A hungry family could buy food for months; a banker might blow that amount on a single dinner, not including the wine. The authors go further, though, blaming rising inequality for a host of ills. A radically more equal society would be less stressed, they argue (no rat race!) and more cohesive (less envy!). The money hoarded by the rich could be used to uplift the poor and improve public services.

Hildyard 先生更简洁地表达了这些观点——并带有一些幽默。他对于铺满整个英国地板需要多少张纸币（按5英镑计算是1.7万亿英镑，大约2.1万亿美元）的段子让本评审人微笑，就像他对于无谓奢侈品的相对价格的思考。据说，让英国喜剧演员詹姆斯·科登在你的生日派对上客串一个小时，他喜欢在名人的车里唱卡拉OK，就如同一半公斤的[可卡因](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/12/joe-biden-is-too-timid-it-is-time-to-legalise-cocaine)那样昂贵。

Mr Hildyard makes these points more concisely—and with flashes of wit. His riff about how many banknotes it would take to cover every floor in Britain—£1.7trn ($2.1trn) in fivers—made this reviewer smile, as did his musing on the relative prices of pointless luxuries. A one-hour guest appearance at your birthday party by James Corden, a British comedian who likes to sing karaoke in cars with celebrities, is about as costly as a half-kilo of [cocaine](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/12/joe-biden-is-too-timid-it-is-time-to-legalise-cocaine), apparently.

然而，当涉及实际问题时，这两本书都失去了控制力。究竟如何消灭富人？Hildyard先生支持设立最高工资和大量财富税，以及其他措施。Robeyns女士表示，这将需要一系列政策，并对那些试图过于简化她的想法的人感到恼火，这些人将其描述为100％的边际税率。但是，如果她认真地说1000万美元应该“尽可能成为一个硬性限制”，那将暗示与100％的边际税率非常接近。

When it comes to practicalities, however, both books lose their grip. How, exactly, can one abolish the rich? Mr Hildyard favours a maximum wage and a hefty wealth tax, among other measures. Ms Robeyns says it will require a patchwork of policies and is irritated by those who try to oversimplify her idea by describing it as a marginal tax rate of 100%. But if she is serious when she says that $10m should be “as hard a limit as possible”, that implies something very close to a marginal tax rate of 100%.

这样的政策将引发大规模的逃税。聪明的顾问会竭尽全力帮助富人隐藏他们的财富或将其转移到友好的司法管辖区。如果，不可思议地，政府设法阻止[这类把戏](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/09/13/moneyland-is-an-urgent-expose-of-the-world-of-mega-wealth)，许多富人将移民。如果各国政府都采取类似的限制财富政策，并加强执法如作者所愿，影响将更加严重。

Such a policy would provoke tax-avoidance on an epic scale. Brainy advisers would strain every synapse to help rich folk hide their wealth or shift it to friendlier jurisdictions. If, against the odds, a government managed to thwart [such tricks](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/09/13/moneyland-is-an-urgent-expose-of-the-world-of-mega-wealth), many rich folk would emigrate. And if governments all adopted similar wealth-banning policies and enforcement was tight, as the authors desire, the effects would be even worse.

想象一个世界，每年超过18万英镑，或终身多于1000万美元的收入都将被没收。如外科医生和工程师这样高效的人，更不用说像J.K.罗琳这样的文字巫师，一旦超过这一点就再也没有金钱激励继续工作。也许一些人会因利他主义或对工作的热爱而继续劳作。但许多人会受到诱惑，躺下来，放松，剥夺世界他们非凡技能、进取心和想象力。

Imagine a world where any gain above £180,000 a year, or $10m over a lifetime, was forfeit. Highly productive people—such as surgeons and engineers, never mind word wizards like J.K. Rowling—would have no financial incentive to keep working after that point was passed. Perhaps some would carry on toiling out of altruism or for the love of the job. But many would be tempted to kick back, relax and deprive the world of their exceptional skills, drive and imagination.

此外，考虑这样一个制度给企业家创造的激励。你有一个更好的捕鼠器的想法。在旧体系下，你可能会抵押你的房子筹集资金来建造一家捕鼠器工厂，希望能发笔财。在新体系下，为了少得多的回报，你必须承担相同的风险（比如失去你的家）。

Consider, too, the incentives such a system would create for entrepreneurs. You have an idea for a better mousetrap. Under the old system, you might mortgage your house to raise cash to build a mousetrap factory, in the hope of making a fortune. Under the new system, you must shoulder the same risks (such as losing your home), for a small fraction of the rewards.

潜在的大想法会局限发展。即使你的捕鼠器非常优秀，整个世界可能合理地希望奔赴你门前，借助贷款扩大生产是不明智的。试图建立一个全球业务的财务风险落在你身上。奖励却归他人所有。只有愚蠢的人才敢于这样押注。

Potentially big ideas would stay small. Even if your mousetrap is so good that the world might reasonably be expected to beat a path to your door, it would be irrational to borrow money to expand production. The financial risks of trying to build a global business fall on you. The rewards go to someone else. Only a mug would take such a bet.

或者是政客，用别人的钱进行押注。事实上，大多数需要大量资本的企业——从[芯片](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/10/13/chip-war-traces-the-evolution-of-the-semiconductor-industry)工厂到近海风力发电场——可能必须由国家所有或支持。由于过去一个世纪国有工业的记录一直是充满裙带关系、呆滞和低效，这本应该让作者们三思。

Or a politician, betting with other people’s money. Indeed, most ventures that required hefty capital upfront—from [chip](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/10/13/chip-war-traces-the-evolution-of-the-semiconductor-industry) factories to offshore wind farms—would probably have to be owned or backed by the state. Since the record of state-run industries over the past century has been one of cronyism, sluggishness and inefficiency, this ought to have given the authors pause.

和左翼许多人一样，他们忽略了过去几十年来全球贫困人口的大幅减少，并将焦点集中在国家内部的不平等上，他们坚信资本主义的不公正导致了不断上升的不平等。但是真的吗？费城联邦储备银行的经济学家马克西姆·平科夫斯基和他的合作者在三月份[发表的新估计](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/03/07/globalisation-may-not-have-increased-income-inequality-after-all)表示，在1980年至2019年间，全球不平等显著下降，而国家内部的不平等自上世纪90年代以来几乎没有变化。（尽管资产价格的暴涨后来增加了财富不平等。）

Like many on the left, they gloss over the huge fall in global poverty over the past few decades and focus on inequality within countries, which they are sure is rising inexorably thanks to the unfairness of capitalism. But is it? In March Maxim Pinkovskiy, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and his co-authors [published new estimates](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/03/07/globalisation-may-not-have-increased-income-inequality-after-all) suggesting that global inequality fell dramatically between 1980 and 2019 and that inequality within countries had barely budged since the 1990s. (Though an asset-price boom later increased wealth inequality.)

在一些地方也许仍然有更多再分配的合理理由。但在瑞典乌普萨拉大学对27个富裕国家进行的一项2017年研究中，雅克布·伦德伯格发现其中有五国（奥地利、比利时、丹麦、芬兰和瑞典）的情况已经到达了拉弗曲线的错误侧。也就是说，它们的最高税率已经很高——在瑞典达到约70％——如果减税的话，政府将会筹集更多的资金。

There may still be a reasonable case for more redistribution, at least in some places. But in a study of 27 rich countries in 2017, Jacob Lundberg of Uppsala University in Sweden found that five (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Sweden) were already on the wrong side of the Laffer curve. That is, their top tax rates were so high—adding up to around 70% in Sweden, for example—that their governments would raise more money if they cut them.

认为各国政府可以通过比瑞典更高的税率找到更多现金的想法是妄想的。路易十四的财政部长若阿·巴蒂斯特·科尔贝说：“征税的艺术在于尽可能多地剔除鹅毛却尽可能少地引起尖叫。”他没有接着说：“除非是只大鹅，那就勒死它。” ■

The idea that governments might find a lot more cash from tax rates higher than Sweden’s is delusional. Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV’s finance minister, said that “the art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to procure the largest quantity of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing.” He did not add: “unless it’s a big goose, in which case strangle it.” ■

将摩萨卡如何跻身希腊美食宗殿 (How moussaka made it into the pantheon of Greek gastronomy)
========================================================================

爱国主义改革了经典菜肴 (Patriotism revolutionised a classic dish)
---------------------------------------------------

![近距离看呈现的莫萨卡](https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20240330_CUP005.jpg)

1821年，[希腊](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/11/06/a-new-book-shows-how-the-greek-revolution-shaped-europe)的革命者起义反抗奥斯曼帝国，引发了多年的流血事件，最终在1829年建立了一个自由国家。每年的3月25日，希腊人庆祝独立日，举行游行，并享用*巴卡利阿罗斯斯克达莉亚*，这是一道用大蒜蘸酱精心炸制的鳕鱼。

IN 1821 [GREEK](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/11/06/a-new-book-shows-how-the-greek-revolution-shaped-europe) [revolutionaries](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/11/06/a-new-book-shows-how-the-greek-revolution-shaped-europe) rose up against the Ottomans, setting off years of bloodshed that culminated in the creation of a free state in 1829. On March 25th each year Greeks celebrate Independence Day with parades and abundant feasts of *bakaliaros skordalia,* delicately battered cod with garlic dip.

然而，许多人认为莫萨卡——富有口味的肉末、土豆、茄子和奢华的白汁组合而成的松软方块——是希腊的国菜。它跻身希腊美食殿堂是在希腊独立后约一个世纪。这个国家对这道菜的接受是一个关于传统如何形成以及一个国家的烹饪如何演变的教训。

And yet it is moussaka—sloppy squares of richly flavoured mince, potatoes, aubergines and indulgent béchamel sauce—that many consider Greece’s national dish. Its entry into the pantheon of Greek gastronomy came about a century after Greek independence. The country’s embrace of the dish is a lesson in how traditions are forged and how a nation’s cuisine evolves.

尼古拉斯·特塞曼特斯被视为希腊莫萨卡的奠基人。上世纪20年代，他出版了第一本完整的希腊菜谱《Odigos Mageirikis》（“烹饪指南”），其中包括了六种莫萨卡的配方。他的创意中没有像希腊厨师以往使用的那些刺激味蕾的香料，比如月桂叶和肉桂。特塞曼特斯写道，这些都是近四个世纪奥斯曼统治带来的“侵染”。他讨厌大蒜，也与一般希腊人不同地[讨厌橄榄油](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/13/why-the-price-of-olive-oil-is-soaring)。他表示，古时厨师们从不往锅里撒孜然或其他“东方”香料。

Nikolaos Tselementes is considered the godfather of Greek moussaka. In the 1920s he published the first complete Greek cookbook, “Odigos Mageirikis” (“Cooking Guide”), which included six recipes for moussaka. His creations contained none of the pungent flavours hitherto used by Greek cooks, such as bay leaf and cinnamon. These were “contamination” from nearly four centuries of Ottoman rule, Tselementes wrote. He hated garlic and—unusually for a Greek—[olive oil](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/12/13/why-the-price-of-olive-oil-is-soaring). The chefs of antiquity had not tossed cumin or other “eastern” spices into their pots, he said.

他将政治因素融入食物的努力取得了成功。《Odigos Mageirikis》成为富裕城市厨房的必备用书，一度，“特塞曼特斯”一词成为菜谱的代名词。通过挖掘爱国主义并希腊化家庭烹饪，特塞曼特斯改变了希腊烹饪的面貌。

His efforts to bake politics into food were successful. “Odigos Mageirikis” became a staple of wealthy urban kitchens and the word “*tselementes*” synonymous with a recipe book for a while. By tapping into patriotism and Hellenising the hearth, Tselementes revolutionised Greek cuisine.

并非所有外来影响都是忌讳的。像许多烹饪同行一样，特塞曼特斯对法国美食着迷。这可能启发了他在莫萨卡上撒上绒面的白汁。他的法希融合作品还包括茄子，以及炸过的西葫芦和冬季的朝鲜蓟。食品作家阿格莱亚·克雷梅齐指出，与中东烹饪方式相比，法式的烤菜（一种蔬菜炖菜，裹有白汁和面包糠）更有可能是他的灵感来源。

Not all foreign influences were anathema. Like many culinary contemporaries, Tselementes was besotted with French gastronomy. This may have been what inspired him to coat his moussakas in velvety béchamel. His Gallic-Greek creations also featured aubergine, as well as fried courgette and, in winter, artichoke. The French gratin—a vegetable casserole enveloped in white sauce and breadcrumbs—was a more likely source of inspiration than versions of moussakas cooked in the Middle East, says Aglaia Kremezi, a food writer.

随着厨师和美食历史学家努力挖掘失传的食谱和重现烹饪传统，莫萨卡证明[真实性是一个难以捉摸的概念](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/04/02/in-praise-of-mass-market-american-tacos) 在食物上。文化长期以来互相借鉴，烹饪也因此更加丰富多彩。

As chefs and food historians seek to revive lost recipes and resurrect culinary traditions, moussaka proves that [authenticity is an elusive concept](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/04/02/in-praise-of-mass-market-american-tacos) in food. Cultures have long borrowed from one another, and gastronomy is all the richer for it.

一个适合重新创造的菜肴也更有可能长久存在。特塞曼特斯的莫萨卡至今仍在世界各地的*小酒馆*供应。如今，没有单一的烹饪方法。科孚岛东部的一家餐馆在层层间加入了小龙虾。在英国，厨师们可能添加烤鹅：然后便有了“goussaka”。至于白汁，最好用酸奶拌橄榄油，保持清爽口感。如果他知道的话，特塞曼特斯可能会为之疯狂的。■

A dish ripe for reinvention is also more likely to endure. Tselementes’s moussaka is still served in *tavernas* around the world. Nowadays there is no single way to prepare it. A restaurant in eastern Corfu bakes crayfish between layers. In Britain cooks might chuck in roast goose: lo and behold the “goussaka”. As for the béchamel, it is best kept light by whipping tangy yogurt with olive oil. If he knew, Tselementes would be whipped into a frenzy. ■
